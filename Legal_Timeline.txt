2013- Ongoing Hampden County Corruption


A quick synopsis: I was hit by a car walking through a parking lot, the rear window was broken, so police were called, when they arrived, they arrested me, and they denied me medical attention. I was charged, but officers didn't take my statement, so I wrote my own statement and had it notarized. I gave that statement and my medical records to the district attorneys office and I agreed to go to trial without a lawyer. I had trail and was found guilty, I was order to pay for the damaged window. judge Hadley said i was owed a copy of the receipt, so I was ordered to return weeks later and the ada provided a document and stated that this driver paid for this window out of her own pocket, but I was not allowed to have a copy. 
Then I would learn that this driver did not have car insurance, I would try to report it to multiple lawyers, Springfield's citizen police complaint department, the probation department, the district attorney's office, the mayor's office, the Springfield Police Department, the ACLU, the Department of Justice, the attorney general's office, the Massachusetts state police, the department of industrial accidents, insurance companies, the FBI and even our local news stations. Not one group could offer me any help or an explanation as to why these types of things were being allowed to continue.

Next I would learn that this window was never paid for, that the receipt ada Johnston handed in was a forgery and learned my statement had been altered and someone electronically forged my signature, so I reported this to the district attorneys office, Jon Gay in the clerks office, Springfield's citizen police complaint department, The mayor's office, the Massachusetts State Police the attorney general's office, the governor's office the ACLU again. 
Then I receive court papers stating that I am to appear in court over a forgery charge, I mistakenly thought that this was about discovering that my statement had been altered and electronically forged and that window receipt was fake. My first court appointed attorney Nolan thought my case was amazing, until he noticed who was involved. then I was provided attorney Elaine Pourinski, Soon after this my mental health declined, attorney Pourinski was well aware of everything going on at the time and took advantage of this fact that I tried to commit suicide multiple times. It's pretty obvious now that she was behind that older gentleman placing a gun to my forehead and taking files from me in the hallway to her office right before our last meeting before I was supposed to have trial. She coerced me into pleading guilty, she Knew that I was an emotional train wreck and then I was worried about the safety and well being of my family and friends. She even used her own safety and the fact that she was about to have knee surgery as an excuse to not get police involved, so that none of these violent individuals searched her out and hurt her or her family. 
I did plead guilty in February of 2016 but I did not say what every one had demanded of me, So I haven't been able to acquire a copy of the audio from that hearing.


In order for the story to make sense I need to set the stage.

I met LK in the summer of 2010, in my defense I took her in a 4 mile walk on the East Longmeadow rail trail and warned her I wasn’t looking for a relationship, I wanted her about my strange health issues and that I didn’t feel comfortable, but she was a medical assistant and said she could help me. Got got closer and not long after we got married October 8, 2011. I started medical assisting school at. Branford hall December 2012???
, it was one of those waste of time certificates classes that don’t count as college credits, but leave you in a ton of debt with few job prospects I was close to finished with school when I was hit by that uninsured car, it ruined my perfect attendance, then it ruined my marriage. Being sick and super stressed was a terrible experience and I took it out on my wife at times: I yelled at her for things that weren’t her fault a few times. I couldn’t understand why the system wasn’t helping me, it felt stupid and confused. Obviously know I know I’m dealing with scumbag pieces of trash that don’t care about themselves? Let alone the law. 

I usually start this story after I got hit by the car but I'm going to start this well he was October or November of 2012 I'm going to have to fix this and find a picture I had surgery on my left wrist I had torn ligaments in my surgeon said it looked like Swiss cheese and I couldn't afford to take time off of work so I went back to work and at the time my boss was kind of a crabby **** and he thought he'd be funny and give me a really hard job to do with one arm and I ended up hurting myself because I didn't know I had a genetic skeletal muscle disorder and my hyperthyroidism makes me weak and doctors said that it might affect my joints or I could have an undiagnosed joint disorder. So I was on workers comp at the time that I got hit and I was super worried when police denied me medical attention that that was going to affect my worker's cup, because I've never had anything like that happened to me before. 

find surgery and injury dates???

This day I gave ada Johnston- Sheldon's original statement, a photo 
copy of the security guard statement( Walmart kept the original ),
and copy of some receipts from Walmart showing that I indeed went back and video could 
be acquired. I also informed ada Johnston that I was on workers comp, and  receiving 
medical attention and seeing specialists for some undiagnosed physical issues. 

.i informed her i wanted those officers reprimanded for not allowing me medical care.
they had no right, no medical degrees to decide that for me and just because 
they're pre existing issues, doesn't mean it doesn't feel crippling.

3-7-2013
March 7th I went down to the Springfield Police Department civilian complaint department and filed a complaint I was told that was supposed to be run by civilians but I spoke to a sergeant every time I went there. I already knew my medical results at this point. I handed them a copy of my notarized  statement, a copy of Sheldon's statement and a copy of the Walmart security statement. I didn't tell the officers I already got my medical results back, I wanted them to acknowledge it on their on. i signed a medical authorization form and gave those officers the names of my surgeons and primary care Drs. 


Intro

Ai reflection and questions:


3-22-2013 Talked out of a lawyer, I told ADA Katharine Johnston that I was sick, I was hurting and I gave her copies of my medical files, so she knew i had torn rotator cuff and was denied medical attention. and she told me I was going to have to wait around all day long for a court appointed lawyer or I could agree to represent that myself and I could go home right now
i was made to wait around for over hours after i politely told ada kj i was in severe pain,

i was requesting a lawyer. ada kj told me i could be here until close, they didnt 

have any lawyers available and i couldnt leave until i was appointed one.

so i told her i no longer wanted one appointed. she downplayed the seriousness of these charges,

she knew i wasn't feeling well and she saw me as someone she could take advantage of.

this isn't proof and alone isn't grounds for a motion for new trail.

but clearly shows i asked for a lawyer and hours later for some unknown reason changed my mind. 

look to page 4 ada kj also claims complaining witness has an interest in the case

page 5 Judge beattie clearly tells me to have any witnesses and evidence ready 

for the day of my trial. i choose to go to trial anyway












I went to go watch the Boston Marathon my brother was running the race I had wanted to but I felt physically horrible I was barely holding it together and I got some pictures that way I thought were absolutely crazy. When the first bomb went off I thought it was just fireworks that's what it smelled like anyways and we are about 100 feet away I believe when the second bomb went off that's when the panic started we were by Uno's pizzeria so we were able to kind of hide behind a little brick wall and I was able to watch everybody fleeing and panic it was terrifying, the police had no clue what was going on.




It's horrifying but in the first pictures I took I caught one of the bombers with one of the backpack bombs, you can see in the 4th picture the smoke from the first bomb and part of the Uno sign where we were standing

Trial day, i was told that judge Hadley said i couldn't have the drivers car insurance info my ada Johnston and Ada Edward Kivari. they said judge Hadley said it whether she had insurance or not didn't matter cause the driver is claiming i attacked her car for no reason. Judge Hadley also claimed that my jury was sent home by accident.
5-1-2013

5-1-2013

i agreed to trial. Ada kj played down the seriousness of my case, she told me judge Hadley 

denied me the information i had asked her for. she also told me i had nothing to worry about, i didn't

have any priors and she doesn't know why Kishana cares so much. 

judge Hadley told me my jury was sent home by accident, i tried getting audio or a transcript of
this, but i was refused on numerous occasions

crazy to think had i known information was intentionally deleted from my police reports, or 
if i had been allowed to get a closer

look at those color photos i didn't know existed until after my trial started.


page 18 Kishana makes comment about color photo and mirror damage. that also shows a red sticker 
for safety and she knew about that. but i couldn't see it

page 33 strange look in my eye ( from waiting around in pain and freezing for over a half hour)

page 36 end of page, officer says i seemed unhappy i was (being denied medical attention and) being arrested.
and that i tightened up when cuffed( because of my injuries perhaps)

 page 37 admitted talking to two witnesses one was a security guard? and another person who couldn't be 
found.

page 37 into 38 officer admits not having any idea why i was in pain, then is clueless as to
 the severity of my injuries and openly mocks me with a comment about me being allowed to wash my 
hand is his version of medical treatment.


in officer Sheehan's testimony,  he totally leaves out what

the Walmart security guard told him about my previous injuries and what i told him

.the security guard statement is verified by police investigators a month or so after my trial, investigators

confirmed i obtained a statement from that security officer and he stated he told them about my injuries. 

page 40  not allowed to read my statement. ada Johnston already had a copy, so didn't ask for or want another. 

page 43 ADA Johnston claims there isn't any proof damage was sustained, 
but i had provided proof to her in the form
of medical documents provided to me by my surgeons. i didn't have 
these injuries before this accident, i know this
because i was on workers comp being treated by these drs for months before 
encountering the Springfield police department

Page 50 Judge Hadley comments on the-not great quality of the video. he also says he watched it on
a smaller screen, which usually makes things harder to see. i don't understand why he wouldn't enlarge it.
   also he states the two computers wouldn't with that video. 


page 51 ADA Johnston mocks? my mental state. 

page 52 ADA Johnston brings up her assessment of my mental state, then trying to make me out to be a monster
end of 52 ada Johnston takes about restitution being owed and not knowing the amount. they didn't have invoice.
pg 52 how can anyone file charges against me, if you didn't know the price of or
if the window was ever paid for?

page 53 ADA claims Kishana reached out to get the price of the unpaid window. wouldn't Kishana have known if she 
paid for it? it was picked up the next day. Kishana also knew she didn't have insurance. so why would she have left
before the insurance was verified, if she knew she didn't have it? 

page 54 Judge Hadley clearly says -I'll give the commonwealth ten days to provide any evidence ad here's the kicker-
IF they're seeking restitution. they didn't have to, they didn't have to make a phony receipt and lie about
 paying for it. 
Judge Hadley also says i was supposed to be provided a copy.  continued into 55 now he says statue requires restitution.


page 56 judge Hadley doesn't want me to seek any mental help for my issues- hyperthyroidism. ada Johnston was
 trying to push it

I don't know if anybody noticed at the end of my trial but the district attorney's office it didn't have the receipt that they claimed I owed money for and they magically had no idea what the price was and I didn't pick up on that, I was too sick to notice.
I returned to court 5-10-2013 I wasn't allowed to have a copy of the receipt ada Johnston handed in, i learned the following year that the receipt was fake, she lied about it being paid for to the court.

5-10-2013

line 13 page 3 ADA Johnston says it was her understanding that
 your honor just wanted us to provide you with paperwork.
She never provided me anything.

line 19 page 3 I state i haven't seen a copy

lines 22-24  pages 3 ADA lies for whatever reason about the price of 
the window and how it was paid for.

line 20-25 page 6- judge Hadley claims that me having the name of her
insurance company is a civil matter. He knows that I can't just call every insurance 
company and ask if this girl has insurance with them.

page 7 line 24-25 I told judge Hadley i was unemployed. i was told that was correct by ada Johnston because i was on workers comp.
I'm still not working, but get disability. so I'm technically still unemployed. 

page 8 into page 9 I tell judge Hadley about my license getting suspended because of this,
how come i don't qualify for the Kishana Johnston plan of no insurance or reg or valid inspection sticker?
is it because i look like i need help?

page 9 4-11 how come Judge Hadley knows all the laws that can hurt people with invisible illnesses, but
he doesn't have any ideas about ways to help them? judge Hadley knows people can be charged for rubbing
dirty shoes on a car carpet in anger. this law really seems like something designed to attack people in group homes, people that have developmental disabilities or that have been abused. damage can amount to $1. and then peoples lives can be ruined by the commonwealth




after this court date, i hired two lawyers, i was told by both attorney randy milo and attorney eric Applebaum that
 they were both denied a copy of that window receipt. i asked multiple times and was told they
weren't able to get a copy because of the information on it.

Eric Applebaum tried to file a claim with Kishana's insurance company,
it was rejected, because she didn't have insurance, but I'll get to that. ADA
 Johnston is going to mention me being denied this insurance claim 9 months from now, 
on court date- 2-28-2014 page 10
did one of these lawyers tell her they weren't going to help me and was feeding her my information? 

 what could i have done different?
no one has ever told me who i could turn to, someone that is honest within the court system.

5-23-2013
Right after my trial I talked to the lawyer services and paid for a lawyer attorney randy Milo, he's also the one that his partner Eric Applebaum. Over the years I've seen Randy Milo and Attorney Johnston very chatty together both in and outside of court.

Find out about those color photos the day of trial and fight to get copies: it never happened. I fought with attorney Randy Milo trying to get these color photos and he filed a motion to withdraw





I finished medical assisting school with high honors and wasn't able to use my education because of the malicious damage to a motor vehicle charge on my record

and then I learned that the police had filed a fake report and left off information, so i called fitchet,
This goes all the way back to 1994 when my friend Tammy Lynds went missing. Right now acting Springfield police superintendent is someone i know from my past, Larry Akers was one of my soccer coaches during the period that Tammy went missing in 1994, i believe he was a detective at the time. His son also played on my soccer team. I ran into Akers again in 2013 he looked like he was a patrol officer then, this was while trying to file a complaint against his fellow officers for denying me medical attention. I had asked him about my friend Tammy at this time and he had no answers and I asked him if I was ever really a suspect and he said no and by the way he responded I honestly believed him.

6-5-2013

I got the response to my complain, it's hilarious that

those involved purposely left out 98% of my medical history.

they could've used that information to at least attempt to explain

their unlawful behavior. all my drs first judged me by my looks,

they missed vital information that could've helped me in many ways.

all of my issues are documented, whether i was able to describe them in 

a way drs understood is a different matter. i never lied to my drs,

that's why i have all my answers today. Same officer who initially took my report handed me the R5

6-19-2013
I used this piece of evidence every time I went back to court along with every other inconsistency I found the police report missing her insurance and registration information. I brought all of my medical records every time. I was a broken record. You can see by the plaintiff exhibit stamp that the court was well aware of everything that was going on and they chose to ignore it. I went down to the mayor's office and filed a complaint about being denied medical attention and this girl driving illegally and policed aided her

Ai reflection and questions:
and then I retuned to Maple st 8-8-2013 to see about filing a new complaint and asked about the girls insurance info, the officer handed me an incomplete R5 document after I asked. the driver was driving with a suspended license at the time. I aquire a complete R5 from a person named Brandon at the registry of motor vehicles on 5-29-2014 and from Massachusetts police 6-13-2014
I also sent emails to channel three news and spoke with a guy downtown Springfield and he said he was going to look into my case and then I never heard from him again and I drove down and channel 22 news in Chicopee I spoke to someone outside their news station and they were supposed to look into things and then I never heard from them again. Gave them copies of all the files I had at the time.

8-8-2013

went down to complaint department asking for registration and insurance info. 
discovered officer who provided my report also tampered with it
on 5-29-2014 after talking to Brandon at the registry. Same officer who initially took my report


I reported the complaint officers altering and leaving out medical evidence to the 

mayors office, the mayor was even in the office that day. it was just ignored.

 shoulder MRI results arrived to dr march 5, I filed complaint on  march 7

that means police also lied in my complaint, they state I signed a medical release 

and that my xrays didn't show any signed of injury. of course not, the injury was on

my MRI report. even my dr said I had full range of motion and thought I was exaggerating 

before the march 5-2013 results came back. Investigators can pick and choose what

information can be left out of reports? this is ridiculous

8-9-2013 notified i had to appear in court for violation.



8-12-2013
I was ordered to show up to court for violating the anger management I was supposed to go to. i hadn't Started yet. Talking to the probation officer Janet Eli. Knew about the girl's lack of car insurance and me being denied medical insurance and being injured. I brought Judge Hadley a copy of the paperwork showing that Kishana did not have insurance that day and he said he needed the district attorney's office there to see it and then he went and had a conversation with Janet Eli in the backroom and I was allowed to leave. The violation was dismissed

8-20-2013
8-20-2013 I had a worker's comp meeting with the Department of industrial accidents this morning before I had to show up in court. I reported what was going on to the insurance company , my workers comp lawyer, to the Department of industrial accidents and they had no idea who to report these types of crimes to. Judge Hadley had that backroom conversation with Janet Eli and I was disgusted I didn't know how this could be allowed. Judge Hadley also said that he could not read this evidence unless Ada was present but he read the evidence and then said that which is pretty stupid but whatever.

I ended up needing to have surgery on my torn rotator cough in my right shoulder and then it got infected while I was going to probation that was horrible I wasn't allowed to miss glass so I had to go to the emergency room after class one night
11-7-2013

11-7-2013

I ran into the security guard who originally spoke to me all those months ago

was able to write me a newer statement along with giving me the original

that Walmart still had on file. I gave copies of both of these to ADA 

Katharine Johnston

this was a couple weeks before my shoulder got infected 


Janet Ely said I couldn't miss my FAKE anger management class,

so i was forced to sit through that worthless nonsense, and then 

went to the ER after

and then on 11-13-2013 Paid 311 for window even thought judge Hadley and the district attorneys office still hadn't given me a copy of the receipt. After surgery I still had to work off my probation fees.

 I tried to pay off my probation fees with the Hampton County District courts program but they sent us to Belchertown and had us doing physical labor at the Swift River Sportsman's club, where I'm pretty sure this probation guy lived, we were cleaning brush so that they could pheasant hunt. I believe that was the birds they were shooting. these invasive bushes started growing and they wanted free labor to clean it up.

and then I was receiving threats and I filed the restraining order against that driver because I was continuing to look into this case and then my case got bumped up from February 20th to the 12th
2-12-2014
2-12-2014

amazing that I was attacked on the same street that someone in my case 

lived on but I wouldn't find out about that until sept 4, 2014.

what did police do with the video from the day of my attack? 

I talked to the Manager Roger from napa and he confirmed that officers came and picked it up and he was 

able to see the black SUV involved in my attack and he confirmed people entering 
and exiting that vehicle that was waiting for me up near Boston rd.
 

I wonder if it also showed someone driving illegally who lived on that street,

just a couple houses away headed to court after my attack?

IT'S A 2 MINUTE WALK from my house TO THIS PERSONS HOUSE, 463FT ACCORDING TO GOOGLE MAPS.
Intro
What was supposed to happen:
what actually happened:
why it matter:
Ai reflection and questions:










I'm going to learn that the girl lived on the same street I was attacked on the Little Red Arrow is where I live the Blue Circle with a line is where I was attacked the pink area up the road like 60 feet is where the car was parked and waiting that red little squash rectangle area to the left is where she lives and up above the little red circle with the line is where I had to take the bus to court after I'd gotten stabbed they're slashed whatever the person had a box cutter, the police never looked into it and did anything idiots




and then 2-28-2014 asked judge Hadley for stuff
judge had proof driver was driving illegally(entered in docket) and that meant officers aided and abetting her when they covered it up.
2014-2-28


up until this point i still hadn't received a copy of the window invoice

page 3 i told judge Hadley about ada saying he denied my request. which she 
said also included the receipt because it had insurance info on it.
even though judge Hadley stated i was to receive a copy on 3-10-13

page 4 i bring back up the 12-17-2012 cancelled reg and insurance, judge Hadley never 
questions it or asks the ADA why Kishana wasn't issued a ticket. 

page 6 I bring up the R5 report i received from the detective doing my 
investigation against officers denying me medical attention. this officer also
alter the copy before handing it to me, i didn't know at the time, but the sticker
 numbers and date confirm her vehicle failed for safety and they knew. 

at the end page 6. judge Hadley comments, well, that's whether someone paid for that damage.
this is why i kept trying to get a copy of the receipt, so i could contact the window installer.
clearly judge Hadley states that paying for that window mattered, he said page 55 on 5-1-2013

page 7 told judge Hadley about ombudsman and he still acted indifferent. going into 8 and 9.

Page 10 sounds like the ADA openly mocking me, she brings up the rejected claim, it was rejected because Kishana 
was driving illegally according to ma state law. she had the paperwork, is she pretending to not
 understand how insurance works.

page 12  THE COURT: So, she wasn’t cited, she wasn’t charged, but
you’re alleging that somehow, the police would’ve - you think -
run her plate or done some --
MR. STEBBINS: I spoke --
THE COURT: -- hold on - done some further research, put
that in a police report, then erased it and that they knew it, it 
was in a police report, but it was deleted and not told to you? 
That’s your allegation, right?
page 13 first paragraph, ADA Johnston confirms that the registration should be there,
it was suspended and that isn't reflected in my police report.
its also missing the (red) rejection sticker for safety information.
she even claims there's no reason to believe anything would've been deleted
or that any information would've been withheld. 


page 14 ADA states how she would be surprised if officers deleted information,
she herself had information questioning my guilt and also forgot about it? and withheld 
statements i gave her, hoping no one else would read them. I still hadn't found my altered statement at this point. 

second paragraph she isn't correct when she says this report is a full and accurate representation
of what officers view, its hiding the lack of insurance, suspended registration and failed inspection.
Officers would have t be suffering from some sort of mental illness themselves
 to miss this information on their screens. because it's in the color photos in the docket. 
we'll get to that in 


page 19 Judge Hadley clearly remembers(absolutely crystal clearly) what he imagined he saw in that video.
perhaps he forgot his comments about the poor quality of the viewing equipment provided by the commonwealth,
the day of my trial.
I put the videos on Youtube for all to see. 
Does judge Hadley remember also saying I was supposed to be provided a copy of the invoice, that he commented 
might not have been paid for this very day. page 54-55 5-1-2013
what about 5-10-2013 didn't provide me a copy of that receipt

and then on may 20th 2014 

Here is a copy that someone in the office was able to get me. I wasn’t allowed to go pick this up. I was told I had to wait for the one in the mail. I’m so happy I had someone in the office making copies of things that they thought were illegal







over the phone i was made aware that my file was found and 
my judgement was already in the mail. 5-21-2014 received court order, went to stapled and faxed, plus called court to complain about court order not addressing car insurance. 
how do files go missing?

and then judge boyle ignored pleas and wouldn't let me talk about my statement being altered
5-20-2014 I had to pay $500 to get my license back for that woman was allowed to drive illegally and the police never stopped her





5-21-2014


at this point i was upset with judge Hadley when i received this court order,

it was once again deflecting the insurance issue and window receipt. 

the fact Kishana didn't pay for her car window and i was constantly refused a copy of that 

receipt was the only thing i was focused on. so i tried to see another judge.


if i had forged that court order, why not ask for the window receipt info that i already knew about?  

I talked to both Jon gay and Edward kavari about all of this and they ignored me. 

i didn't know the receipt had a paid stamp on it either at this point or that the amount had been changed.



all this could've been avoid had someone prevented me from seeing the actual receipts. it 

had already been over a year, no one thought to go pay for this window before i was able to acquire a copy?

this is exactly the

behavior i described when i claimed Kishana Johnson's insurance, registration and sticker information

were intentionally deleted from my reports.


when i called CJIS and spoke with whoever, it's noted that i asked not to print the entire order.
i didn't want to involve someone i asked to look into this, after i found out she didn't have insurance
, incase they did look up her information when i called
and asked him about my problem. running an R1 would've shown she had a suspended license from
 days after my accident,
if he ran her R5, he would've seen her failed sticker

5-22-2014
5-22-2014

clerk was able to get me a copy of my altered statement. i informed John Gay and ADA 

Edward Kavari. nothing was done.

call from rosemary court 5-22-2014




5-27-2014 
Judge Boyle Ignored evidence i provided the court

I'd provided the police report, my unaltered notarized statement and the altered version, the fake receipt I found inside the court docket, the actual receipt I got from the window place, copies of my medical records, and the complaint from the civilian department, copies of this girls lack of insurance. I was dismissed before I could speak.



5-29-2014 learned that driver always drove illegally, never had insurance.

May 29th I talked to Brandon from the registry of motor vehicles and he was able to give me an insurance inspection inquiry, a list of when this woman didn't have insurance over the last couple years, and a correct R5 that shows that the officer from the civilian complaint department did not give me a full R5 when he printed it out for me. The rejection status was missing from the officer's version.

5-29-2014


after a ridiculous amount of effort, i was able to get a registry employee

to help get me legal copies of a registration/title inquiry without a court order.

through this information i was able to confirm that Springfield police officers did in fact delete information 

from their reports. An R5 from the MA state troopers shows both police print outs have 

been altered by different Springfield police officers at different times for different reasons.

i did this because i felt judge Hadley was trying to withhold information from me,  i

wanted to prove how hard it was to obtain information and to prove i wasn't a liar.


Intro
What was supposed to happen:
what actually happened:
why it matter:
Ai reflection and questions:


Don’t forget that Brandon told you that driver registration was suspended for both taxes owed to Chicopee and lack of insurance. That’s tax and insurance fraud cause she lived in Springfield a few houses away from me. She lived in colonial estates before that, that’s also in Springfield. Judge Hadley, Ada Johnston and those Springfield police officer aided and abetted her, then conspired to cover it up.

ADA Johnston finds forged court order she was waiting for. even though it was addressed to someone else. she was alerted 6-3-2014

6-3-2014

ADA katharine Johnston 


what happened to the original copy of the court order for the video 
from Walmart that ADA Johnston had?? She only gave me a copy that i gave to Walmart.
ADA Johnston also had originals of my statement that was notarized
and Sheldon's statement. she only had a copy of the security guard 
statement, because he gave me a copy and kept the original at Walmart.


reminder: I was able to obtain the original statement from Walmart security after i 
was reminded it existed by the report i got from police 
investigating my complaint against officers Thomas Sheehan and Thomas Douglas.
i then went back to Walmart for a copy and he handed it to me.

staff snuck me copies of reciept judge hadley and ada johnston tried to hide from me 6-13-2013






6-13-2014
Then I went to the window place to see how this driver paid for our window since she didn't have car insurance, that's when i learned ada Johnston lied about the window being paid for.
The owner of the window shop wasn't gonna give me a copy of the receipt to return to court because he didn't believe anyone was ever going to pay for it, so I paid for it and brought a copy back to court. I never asked the owner how much the receipt was I simply offered to pay for it he said okay and I went by what the court had told me it was and I had previously paid to the court. It wasn't until I got to court that I noticed that the prices were different and that the original unaltered price was $245, less then the 311 claimed. I went back to the window shop and accused the owner of changing the price and he became furious with me and demanded that I leave. I said I was going to call the cops and report what he did. And he said I never asked him what the price was I just said I would pay for it and I ran off and then I came back with a money order. He told my better leave right now and then he prays I get some help. I asked him well why is the price different, and he said he didn't know he said that the $245 was the price that he faxed to the insurance company and that the driver never returned to pay for her window when it came back that she did not have insurance. He said another woman came and asked for a copy of the receipt and said she needed it for court and she never came back and paid for the window either. I'm lucky that guy didn't knock me out he was way bigger than I was and he looked like he was pissed and I was rude and disrespectful and I don't know, I have no excuse for my behavior I was sick at the time so it was my fault i jumped to conclusions without asking him. thankfully I got him to write that statement before I pissed him off. lol

6-13-2014 after people ignoring me at the courts, i went to the state police and asked for their help. they gave me papers but didn't know what to do or who to contact. They didn't know why the R5 the officer that the complaint department gave me didn't have her rejection sticker information on it. it should have been there.









and then 6-20-2014
2014-6-20


sent conflict of interest, i was told because judge Hadley is friends with members

of Kishana family, they don't want there to appear to be any conflicts of interest.

her cousin works in the clerks office, sister works with the district attorneys 

office in some capacity. In the beginning I thought this case was because I caught somebody tampering with my statement. I had no idea it was about a phony court order at first. Seeing that my statement was notarized.




and then 
7-9-2014
2014-7-9

when i first learned of this forgery charge, i was super excited.

i thought the courts were going to do something about my altered 

notarized statement with the forged electronic signature. When I met my first attorney Nolan he was super excited and thought this case was a slam dunk. At some point, he was forced to step aside because of a conflict of interest, but he told me to file another complaint at the mayors office and a complaint at the US attorneys office at the federal building on State Street and I went down there and I was ignored.








and then KJ got harassment order against me when i learned she lived on my street.
9-9-2014
2014-9-9

Kishana is able to get a harassment order against me.
once i found out she lived up the street, i had contacted the 
Springfield police to report her lying about her address and 
using a fake address for her insurance and excise tax.
they told me to go f myself. I'm actually really shocked that her insurance company didn't try to file any charges against her that the state didn't try to file any charges against her for tax evasion or insurance fraud. I believe she was also getting assistance at the time so

i tried once again to report the illegal activity i found going on.

courts denied my attempts at showing what i found.

i also noticed the signatures on the harassment order and those

 auto glass receipts were different, so i went to court and paid

 for a copy of the check they mailed Kishana, so i could get a better 
look at her signature

12-23-2014 bay state emergency room and psych ward notes.


Attorneys John Nolan and Elaine Pourinski both agreed that my evidence was
more than enough to clear my name of any wrong doing. attorney Nolan had to excuse himself
 because of his friendship with ADA Katherine Johnston and it being a case she was involved in.
Attorney Pourinski even had an investigator corroborate everything I'd said in my previous statements in a 2015 meeting.
he even questioned me as to why i paid for the window, while we were all in her office. 
I told them that on 5-19-2014 Edward Kavari told me since the shop manager won't give me copies or write a statement, 
about the window( because he was worried he'd never get paid for it), he suggested that i should pay for it, 
then no one can argue restitution, because there is none. i also told ADA Kavari about the ombudsman Judy saying
that i can call while in the court room and she'll just tell Judge Hadley himself that Kishana's r5 was accessed  
1-16-2013 at 2:49 and she can name the officer, that way i won't break any privacy 
laws, even though there's nothing private about it. it's just an officer name a time and a license plate number.
I never got to talk to Mr Kavari after i was able to save enough to pay for the
 window, i wasn't able to inform Kavari or ADA Johnston when i returned to court on 6-13-2014 when i was finally 
able to afford what i thought was $311.51, that the receipt was also a fake.
the investigator was able to confirm that $245.94 was the amount submitted to the insurance company.
The investigator even confirmed that i went back to the window repair company and annoyed the 
manager after discovering the fake receipt and different total. ( at this point i was unaware of the fake court order, 
and even when i first received the forgery court date, i thought it was because i found out someone altered my 
notarized statement deleting pages and electronically forging my signature. so i kept looking for more evidence to prove
Kishana and the officers were hiding something. i reported my statement being altered to John Gay 5-22-2014, my 
file had been missing for some time at this point, i kept trying to get audio of judge Hadley telling
 me my jury had been sent home by accident,
so i was regularly calling the court house and asking Paul in the office if he had any luck finding  that part of the audio
 from the day of my trial or if judge Hadley's ruling had come back on my motion for new trial)
 I went down to the court house 6-13-2014 after paying for the window with all the paperwork 
the manager gave me and a statement he wrote stating Kishana never returned to pay for the 
window and didn't have insurance at the time of the accident. 
I tried to talk to ADA Edward Kavari or Katherine Johnston, I wanted to show 
someone in the ADA's office what i had found, but they both unavailable. 
this time while i was there, I was able to obtain a photo of the original receipt, someone in the office finally 
let me see physically the receipt on the counter ( instead of just telling me about it as had been the case for a year),
but they still didn't feel safe giving me a physical copy.  
In the photo you can see the fake receipt has a red paid for stamp and a date. at this point i know everyone at the court house heard
me run my mouth as to what i had discovered. so of course i 
wanted to know why the amount on the receipt the auto glass guy gave me and the one that ADA Katherine presented to
 Judge Hadley was different than the one i had just paid for. 
so I went back the net day because the manager wasn't in the shop when i drove by.
Needless to say, i probably didn't sound very polite when i asked why he gave Kishana a paid for receipt
if she didn't pay for it, i wanted to know why he increased the amount of her receipt and . I'm pretty sure
this is where i wore out my welcome. the Auto glass guy said he never gave me a price, i only asked if she
paid for it and if i could pay for it and then ran off after i paid for it before he could say anything. 
he told me he already deposited it and aske me to leave. i tried to get him to write another statement and
he kindly told me he was a religious man and thought i needed to let this go. that was the last i spoke with him


The investigator even confirmed no one went back to the window company to ask about or pay for the window
 after i reported it down at the court house.


i believe those superior court judges, their prosecutor and my appointment attorney Elaine Pourinski
showed depraved indifference to my plight.
they all took advantage of the fact that i was in and out of the hospital for multiple suicide attempts.

My health took a turn for the worst the end of sept 2015, i started to grow breasts from the medication i was given
by drs, i still hadn't been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism at this point. i was taking medication for issues i was 
misdiagnosed with, then i spent time in the psych ward for a suicide attempt from cutting myself.

during this rough time my attorney Elaine Pourinski said the prosecutor made an offer of a cwof and that if i accept
 this, my previous guilty finding would be changed to a cwof as well and since it was over a year, would 
automatically be off my record. but i had to agree not to present the window receipt against Kishana 
and not to pursue any civil actions against any officers involved. i agreed due to my health issues.
December 2015 i again suffered some sort of nervous breakdown for no reason and attempted suicide again by swallowing
hundred upon hundreds of all the depression/bipolar medication i was prescribed. i have very little memory of 
my time in the psych ward this time,  next thing i remember it's Christmas eve and I'm no longer in the psych ward.


12 days later Jan 5-2016 rolls around and the judge doesn't agree to the terms of the cwof.
  
i still wanted to fight the charge and was still willing, then Jan 19-2016 i suffer another 
mental break down for no apparent reason. i can recall putting a bed against the door and then trying 
to strangle myself with a sheet wrapped twisted around my neck as tight as i could 
get it, i leave the psych ward Jan 25-2016, i had another meeting with my
attorney elaine Pourinski before my trial date of Feb. 5-2016 11 days later. before this meeting, in the hallway 
outside her office in Northampton, an older white male placed a hammerless revolver to my forehead, he took the file that I had brought with me and warned me
not to move forward with my evidence. I was told to plead guilty.
I informed my attorney after the incident and she said there was nothing she could do to help me, i was
 still stubborn and wanted to fight the charges and she kept telling me how afraid she was not 
just for herself and her family, but for my safety and my families.
I can't remember where I talked about this but the only papers I haven't been able to recover are the police report that I got from my buddy Joe that shows the type of information that was deleted off of mine report because he was also involved with an uninsured illegal driver. And I don't have copies of the complaint reports I filed Springfield Mayor Sarno's office


i didn't want to plead guilty, i was made to feel i had to plead guilty, that i didn't have a 
choice. i was told by my attorney the first judge knew about the fake receipt Kishana supposedly
 produced and about the police tampering with their reports,
which the state police also proved for me. i felt so sick and didn't have anything in me after this last psych 
ward stay, less than 2 weeks earlier and with the thought of having that gun to my head so fresh in my sick mind. 
i plead guilty.
come to find out, i had undiagnosed hyperthyroidism all my life. blood test from Jan 2016 -march 2016 can confirm
even when i tried to kill myself back in 2005 can be tied to 
an episode of severe reaction to hyperthyroidism and a past blood test that was over looked proves it.
 since i was on workers comp at the time of the accident and 
for a short time after my first trial 2013,
i was able to get a closed period disability payment for the time that i called to sign up for, this was right after i got 
off of workers comp.

then i discovered the reason for officers Sheehan's comment about my tightening up while being arrested,
after being forced to stand around for over half hour in the cold with improper attire. 
turns out i have a untreatable, incurable genetic skeletal muscle disorder, not only was i right about having a problem,
it was even worse than i could've imagined.
i tried to keep working after that, but kept needing surgeries and couldn't take time off,  i had to work with casts on.
i got sick physically from all of that and filed for permanent disability and wasn't even allowed to complain about all my issues and they
cold kill me, before the judge stopped me and told me not to worry about it and i would be getting permanent disability.


I don't have the court transcripts yet from when I was coerced in pleading guilty in Superior Court in Hamden County, but i I didn't say what I was supposed to I told them I didn't remember forging that document because I'd never forged it and I told them that I'd wanted it to prove that Springfield police denied me medical attention even though I didn't need it I had far more evidence against them.
After I spoke to the girl in probation in Springfield that was desperate find something to help me expose what was going on, but she couldn't help me at all. I moved in with my father again in West Warren in his duplex and I was transferred to Worcester for probation for the rest that time.

Worcester therapist 2-29-2016
Even though that court appointed therapist did not document when I told him I was coerced into pleading guilty. He did note that my neighbor saw someone walk up the street from that girl's house in place that court order in my mailbox. He used to work 3rd shift so he was up at different hours and home at different hours. I told the second court therapist up the street from the courthouse these same stories because I went there for multiple visits I have not been able to get those notes yet but this therapist was completely worthless as well and had no idea who to report these types of crimes to and I was totally left on my own to deal with it and suffer the consequences of trying to stand up for what is right

I'm excited to face Judge Hadley again I think he's one of the most pathetic, worthless pieces of trash that Massachusetts could have ever picked for a judge. I feel blessed that I met him. Honestly I didn't think that he would ever face me again anyway, he's such a coward. It's kind of hard to face somebody when they've caught you bold faced lying and acting so stupid that you can't even pretend that you're not completely stupid.

MY STATEMENT TO WARREN POLICE
10-4-2021

Warren Police Statement 
Page 1 of 5
After leaving my apartment on October 4, 2021 I was approached by two Warren police
officers, I had been walking South on route 67 for almost 2 hours with my dog. Both officers
told me they were wearing body cameras and I was being recorded, they asked if I was
Richard Stebbins, I said yes, they asked where I was going. I told them to my mothers, my
sisters almost here. They informed me they received a phone call saying I was fighting with my
girlfriend and they asked me if I mind telling them what was going on. I told them that my
girlfriend Beth was very upset and she was arguing with herself and begging me to stay. Beth’s
autistic son was being abused and neglected in a local group home, we had been filing reports
about it, trying to protect him, yet nothing was being done and a new manager that was just
assigned to his house, who was also going to help us expose this abuse and neglect, had just
been fired that morning.
I told officers Beth was also upset about some things my family members had said, my father
told me he didn’t want me getting another car, he didn’t want the driveway looking like a
parking lot, so Beth said she was going to speak with him and stated that she was going to
buy me a car, even though we are having issues with how to access her money at the moment,
so I didn’t know what she was thinking, she just seemed angry.
I told the officers that Beth was very adamant that I get my court paperwork in order to get my
record expunged because she wanted me to become co-guardian of her son Stephen, so I
could deal with all the abuse her son was enduring, since she was totally overwhelmed by it.
I told officers I asked Beth to give me some time, since she knows I am physically disabled,
she knows I have a genetic skeletal muscle disorder and I told her my neck was hurting and I
have a migraine, I tried to get away from Beth, but she kept following me around the house and
insisting that I do what she wanted right then and there, she wanted me listen to what she had
to say, then she followed me upstairs
I told officers that Beth followed me in our middle bedroom, closed the door and held me
against my will for a half hour, preventing me from leaving, threatening to call the police if I
moved her out of the way or if tried to get by her. She kept threatening me, saying she’ll tell
police that I hit her. I told officers, that’s when I told Beth I hadn’t heard any of the other things
she said, I told her I stopped listening when she threatened to call the cops on me, that’s when
she got this crazed look in her eyes and said if I do leave, she’ll never stop and she said she
hopes I do kill myself this time. I told the police that’s when I picked my dog up and used her
as a shield so that Beth would allow me to leave the room, I told Beth to get the fuck out of my
way and that’s when finally Beth left the room and allowed me to exit.
Then I went downstairs, as I was putting my dogs harness on, Beth took that opportunity to
snatch my backpack which had my medication, my dogs medication and other personal
items, Beth was still trying to prevent me from leaving so I left without my backpack. I told
officers that Beth was hoping that these threats of a police officer hurting me and the courts
ruining my life, would force me to stay, but I told her I didn’t care, I told her I just wanted to
leave. I wanted nothing to do with her or her childish behavior, she was just acting selfish. Beth
followed behind me when I left, she really didn’t want me leaving. But I don’t think she was
prepared for the weather to be rainy, she wasn’t there when I looked back.
That’s when officers informed me that Beth claimed I accidentally elbow her in the jaw and they
were going to have to place me under arrest. I repeated to officers that I’m disabled and that
Beth said she was hoping you guys would hurt me, I told officers again that my sister was
already on her way to get us and would be here very soon. I asked officers to be gentle with
Harley, one officer said he’s a K-9 officer. I told officers I had a knife on me. I also told them I
had over a dozen joint surgeries. Officers read me my rights

and asked if I wanted to keep talking. I said yes and I told officers I didn’t touch Beth and she
didn’t touch me.
I asked about filing charges against Beth for holding me against my will and stealing my
backpack and officers said I’d have to take it up with a lawyer. I tried pleading and mentioned
the fact that I didn’t snatch my backpack away from her, because I know she also has physical
issues, she’s always complaining about her joints and I know she would’ve been injured if I
yanked it away, officers said there’s nothing they could do about it, since she claimed I
accidentally elbowed her, they said they had to arrest me and neither officer seemed all that
interested. I asked officers multiple times how she’s allowed to get away with this behavior and
they just shrugged. Since officers said they were wearing body cameras, I felt it was important
to keep talking because of their dismissive attitudes and what happened to me in Hampden
county court.
Officers were gentle with me and my dog, while placing me in cuffs and then in the back of a
cruiser, they placed my dog on my lap until my sister arrived. They asked for my license and
asked my contact info. One officer typed things in the computer while the other stood outside
my drivers side rear door.
I told officers this wasn’t the first time Beth locked me in a room and threatened to call the
cops on me if I left, I told them that Beth tried this earlier this year because of the stress she
was going through because of the abuse her son has endured in his Massachusetts group
homes, but I stayed that time and we talked through it. I told them they can go back and ask
Sue, she’s home, I told officers I saw her in front of the sink when I left. I told officers to ask my
sister when she arrives as well, she’s heard Beth tell the story of holding me in the bedroom
dozens of times.
I told officers that Beth was pushing me to get my record expunged because she wanted me to
become her sons co-guardian, I told warren officers I have physical evidence that ada
Katherine Johnston presented a fake receipt in that malicious damage to a motor vehicle case
on my record, she lied about that driver paying for that damaged window. Springfield officers
my altered police report and someone altered the notarized statement that I gave the Hampden
county DA’s office, all to help cover up Springfield officers helping a girl get away with driving
without car insurance and denying me medical attention. I told officers that I wouldn’t have
learned about that receipt if it wasn’t for judge Hadley making facing and remarks.
I told officers that Beth knew about my past suicide attempts and was trying to stress me out,
she was hoping I’d kill myself for leaving her, I also brought up how warren police transported
me to the emergency room in 2016 for a suicide attempt after I escaped the emergency room.
This was after discovering those court documents had been altered and no one I called was
willing to help me, the anxiety caused by my “at the time” undiagnosed hyperthyroidism
caused me to become suicidal.
Officers asked if I was still suicidal, I told them no, it only happens when my thyroid is off. I was
also misdiagnosed with other issues at the time and prescribed meds that made my issues feel
worse. I asked if their vehicles still recorded and they said yes.
I told officers after my last suicide attempt, I had a gun placed to my forehead and the files I
had with me, taken from me at my lawyers office and I was coerced into pleading guilty by my
lawyer Elaine Pourinski, the Supreme Court ada and judge. I didn’t forge that paper and didn’t
need it. I told officers this is the 2016 charge you see on my record. I was a complete disaster
at that time and everyone around me knew it, you officers can see the timeline, I was brought
to the hospital for my third suicide attempt in 4 months, it was the second you officers came to
my home and then I was l coerced into pleading guilty less than two weeks later. thankfully
being positive through that horrible ordeal got me Harley (my dog). that's how I also ended up

Warren Police Statement 
Page 3 of 5
meeting Beth, all this court stuff destroyed my marriage. Beth’s son was also abused in a
different group home than he’s being neglected in now and it was also covered up, that event
destroyed Beth’s marriage.
I told officers that ever since I met Beth her son had been abused and neglected in every
placement chosen by the commonwealth, she's been harassed by group home managers and
lied to by both group home companies and the state workers who are supposed to oversee her
sons care. Beth tried to buy a house, with the hopes of getting him closer, but the state said
they'd take his funding away if he moves into a home Beth or her son owns. The state pays
hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to abuse these kids in group homes and they only
offered Beth a worker to help her 20 hours a week if she took him home. This stuff would drive
Beth into panics, she couldn't understand how the state could display such disgusting
behavior. This caused her to have nightmares every night and it's not like she was making
things up or exaggerating, the things that I witnessed myself were horrible and Beth dealt with
it as best she could, she handled it better than I would have if that was my son. I told Beth she
could have our apartment, I didn't want to deal with these issues anymore, it was to much.
I told officers Beth needed a mental health evaluation, she was talking to herself in our dining
room, pacing back and forth and then telling me I should hit her if I’m so unhappy before
following me upstairs. She really wants me to kill myself, she’s never going to stop. You didn’t
see the look in her eyes. I’ve never seen her that angry. She’s been really upset about the
constant abuse of her son in these group homes, it’s absolutely disgusting and he’s still being
neglected at highland street in southbridge. Like I said his house manager was fired this
morning and Beth doesn’t have anyone to help her with her son, I was the only one who ever
stood up for her and her son.
When my sister arrived, one officer brought Harley over to her, they didn’t ask Kathy about
Beth holding me against my will previously or let her come near me to say anything.
After Kathy left, before one of the officers transported me back to the warren police station, he
radioed in his mileage .
We had to drive past my street “South st” on the way to the station and I asked if the officer
could retrieve my backpack, since it had both my medication and my dog’s heart worm
medication in it, along with other personal items. He claimed there was nothing he could do
and I’d have to speak to a lawyer.
When we reached the station, that officer called in his mileage and informed me he needed to
do paperwork and that I would be recorded again inside the station. I felt very lucky to be
recorded and tried starting my story from the beginning. I told him I wished they had that
recording devices years ago, it would’ve prevented so many problems for me. Again I told him
how I was walking though a parking lot, got hit by a car while I was walking. The cops arrived
and arrested me.
At the time I thought it was all a big misunderstanding. That driver didn’t have car insurance
and had a rejection sticker for safety. This officer asked me the last time I was arrested. Then
walked away and started working on his computer. He nodded indicating he typing, so I
stopped talking.
This officer came back and read me my rights again, I agree yes. He never asks any more
questions, so I assume he remembered everything I said and was documenting it in his
computer. This officer asked for my info again.

Warren Police Statement 
Page 4 of 5
We lingered around at the station for way longer than I expected, the officer was having trouble
taking my finger prints on their electronic scanner and became very frustrated. first he said said
the courts would take me and I’d be released, then he said it was to late the courts wouldn’t be
able to take me, so I’d have to be dropped at the state police station before I could be bailed
out after the court close. I was allowed to use the bathroom uncuffed and alone. When done
the officer places me back in cuffs. He took me out to the vehicle, then went back inside.
This same warren officer transported me to the state police barracks in Brookfield. Before he
left he called in his mileage again.
Along the way I told that officer that Beth knows I’m going to fight this bogus accidental elbow
charge, she’s trying to force me to fight her fights for her. She wants me to expose all the
abuse we’ve witnessed in her sons group home placements. I told this officer how a manager
Rich shook my hand and lied to our faces about making home visits a thing for her son, her
son was constantly restrained and neglected. Then he moves to Uxbridge, the commonwealth
did everything it could to keep him 2 hours away. This new home was just as bad as the last,
her son got a mysterious hand infection that wasn’t documented and then an old manager
Craig comes into the picture and her son starts getting hand prints on his arm, he starts having
weird behaviors in front of this guy. It got so bad I had to pull this guy aside and ask if he
needed help communicating with Beth’s son. This event led to her son moving to the home
he’s being neglected in now. I told the officer about how I drove to this house while recording
the screen. Staff didn’t interact with her son for hours. He was just sitting in a corner doing
nothing. Whenever I see him we go for walks and he’s super curious about what’s going on.
Beth was distraught over that manager being fired this morning. Cynthia seemed like she was
going to be able to help Beth expose all this abuse and neglect going on in these
Massachusetts group homes.
I told this officer about my issues trying to fight that malicious damage charge. I tried to report
Springfield police officers aiding that girl driving without car insurance and deleting it off of my
police report. I told him how I contacted the registry and they confirmed that girl didn’t have
insurance, had a rejection sticker for safety and suspended registration, she also drove around
with a suspended license at times. I told him how I contacted cjis and they confirmed that
officer accessed her license plate info and knew she was driving illegally, I told this officer that
because of judge Hadley I learned the Ada passed in a fake receipt as proof this girl paid for
her window, but I learned from the window place that the girl never paid and skipped out on
the bill. They gave me a copy of the receipt they faxed to her old insurance company. Then I
tried reporting these officers, but their fellow investigators helped cover up how they denied me
medical attention. I also learned the notarized statement I wrote was altered to hide things
officers told me. Once I learned about the receipt being fake, the commonwealth charged me
with forgery and I was ready to fight this in court, but then i got really sick and ended up trying
to commit suicide from all the stress I was going through, then some guy puts a gun to my
head in the hallway outside my lawyer Elaine Pourinskis' office in Northampton. She knew I was
a mess and used that to coerce me into pleading guilty, even though she knew I didn’t forge
anything. The prosecutor and judge were also in on this. We talked in the hallway before
pleading and i was told what the judge wanted to hear. I told the officer how pissed the judge
looked when I said something different. I said I didn’t remember forging it, but I must have
cause I wanted it. Everyone knew I didn’t need it to prove anything, I already had a
preponderance of evidence, but I was sick and I fell apart, then the courts took advantage of
me. After court I was told that I was lucky the judge didn’t throw me in jail for my stunt. I still
haven’t been able to get a recording of that hearing.
I told the officer that Beth and I talked about fighting the commonwealth every single day of our
relationship, she knows all about my issues with the courts and I know all about the horrible
things that happened to her. I told Beth I can’t take this anymore and she won’t let me walk
away. That is why she said I hit her by accident, she really thinks that forcing me into court with

actually help. I told the officer I couldn’t take it anymore, I’ve tried for years to expose what
happened and no one cares, no one ever has any answers. That’s exactly what drove Beth
crazy, she had nightmares every night and constantly worried about her sons safety. Even
though he’s finally closer, these companies still have the same problems and keep lying to our
faces.
Beth isn’t going to stop, she knows how impossible it is to expose all this, she really hopes I
get stressed and kill myself fighting this charge.
Officer called in mileage when we got to state police barracks.
I like to point out that even though warren officers were gentle with me and my dog, given the
nature of my genetic muscle issues and past surgical history, I could've been severely injured
by my arrest, I was no threat to anyone, I consider what they did to be kidnapping, following
Beth's commands. Especially because they failed to charge her for what she did to me. I didn't
touch her and she didn't touch me, she was trying to force me to stay and I wanted to leave.
She had no right to try holding me against my will or using police to do the same. She
shouldn’t have been able to keep my backpack and rummage though my stuff. 


October 14, 2021 restraining order audio that I posted on YouTube shows Beth lying or you can hear Beth lying saying that my father said she could have our apartment and I wasn’t allowed back to the house

https://youtu.be/iiaYXPwptbM?si=x7f1WiNlEh6x2FA4

End of October I meet with Banks, here's what I remember and put in my complaint against him. 
Attorney Banks Page 1 of 14
When I first spoke with Attorney Roger Banks in court October 2021 after being charged with
domestic assault. I was severely traumatized by what my ex Beth Nichols had done to me. I
told him I wanted Beth charged with holding me against my will, threatening to use the police
to hurt me ( I wasn’t sure if there was a legal term for that, but I asked) and I wanted her
charged for stealing my backpack, Attorney Banks told me to wait so we could speak in his
office.
I met with Attorney Banks at his office in Spencer on Wednesday October 27, 2021.
*Attorney Banks started by asking if I did hit Beth and I told him no, I did not hit Beth, I told him
that she was lying and that she said she hoped police would hurt me and she wanted to ruin
my life for leaving her. Again I told Attorney Banks I wanted Beth charged with holding me
against my will, threatening to use the police to hurt me and stealing my backpack.
*Attorney Banks asked me to slow down, he asked what I did for work, I told him I'm on
disability. he asked what Beth did for work, I told him she worked part-time at Big-Y, he asked
how are relationship was, I told him it was great until the day of October 4th. He ask how long
we were dating, I told him 5 years.
*Attorney Banks asked where we lived, I told him in a two family side by side owned by my
father and that my dad and his wife Sue lived next door. He asked if they were home at the
time of this alleged incident, I told him Sue was home with her granddaughter, but my father
was at work.
*Attorney Banks asked if anyone else lived with us, I told him that Beth’s daughter Olivia had
just moved in with us a week prior and things were just getting settled. he asked if we got
along and I said yes, though I didn’t spend much time with her, she had a strained relationship
with her mother in the past and things were finally working out.
*Attorney Banks asked me to explain what happened that day, what led to Beth calling the
police.
I explained how I wasn’t feeling well at the time of this alleged incident, I was having severe
migraines and felt overwhelmed. Beth and I were sitting on our back porch after I had finished
the dishes. I told him that Beth and I always sat out on the back porch and talked, we’d been
talking about the same exact subjects since we first met. I told him Beth seemed like she had
totally lost it that morning, she was never like that before.
*Attorney Banks asked what I meant by lost it, I told him Beth’s son was the focal point in her
life, his safety and well-being meant the world to her and the recent neglect of her son had her
wanting to lash out at others, she had this crazy look in her eyes, so I had wanted to get away
from her.
I told Banks that Beth was also upset that morning about a rash her glasses had been causing
on her face recently, she is allergic to cobalt and she recently learned it was used as a dye in
their construction. She was also upset because she felt people at her job were being hard on
her for no reason and expected more out of her than other people.
I told him how the night before this alleged assault, Olivia had poured some gross water down
the kitchen sink, so I asked Beth to let Olivia know about the sink in the basement, Beth kept
on insisting that I tell Olivia myself, but I felt it wasn’t my place, I told her that people get upset
when I tell them things, but Beth seemed fixated on me telling Olivia myself.

Attorney Banks Page 2 of 14
That’s when Beth said Olivia told her that she noticed that I haven’t seemed as happy as I used
to be. I told Beth that I was feeling burned out, that something about my court papers and her
sons stuff was nagging at me.
I explained that those court papers referred the the felonies on my record. Beth wanted me to
become co-guardian of her autistic son Stephen and she was pushing me to get my record
expunged. Even her ex husband agreed that I should be their sons co-guardian, Beth was
hoping that I would be able to get into court before she and her ex had to refile for
guardianship. Allowing me to speak on her behalf without that paperwork seemed to be an
issue for the state and her sons group home companies.
I told Beth I think I‘m close to ready, but I still needed the audio from my first trial and my
superior court trial. She told me to tell it to her anyway, so I laid it all out for her.
I explained that Beth and I talked about two subjects all the time, my court issues and the
issues she’s had with the state and its cronies allowing the abuse and neglect of her son inside
state funded group homes. There was always a new abuse report or set of bruises. It was a full
time job keeping track of it all and trying to address it.
I explained that Beth wasn’t upset with me, she was upset with all the things that were going
on around us and she wanted to mouth off to people and wanted me to join in. Things were so
bad with the state workers and group home managers we had to deal with, that I felt I had to
start writing emails, instead of talking in the phone, just to keep track of and try preventing the
bold faced lies being told to us over the years.
I told Beth how it’s obvious when going over my court papers that no one cares. The courts
use collective stupidity against citizens.
*I told attorney Banks that I started at the beginning like I always do, Beth knows my ADHD will
have me trailing off, if I don’t focus on one subject and keep things linear.
I was married, in school for medical assisting and on workers comp when this all started, I
hadn't been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism or my genetic skeletal muscle disorder yet,
though I was suffering from their symptoms, so the choices I made weren't the brightest.
I was walking through the Springfield Walmart parking lot back to my car, when out of nowhere
I was struck by a vehicle. I was already injured at the time, unfortunately when the vehicle
struck me, I felt something tear in my right shoulder and then the rear tire stopped on my right
foot, in my attempt to free myself, I stumbled forward, accidentally elbowing the rear window,
shattering it. this all happened in a matter of seconds. The driver jumped out of her suv with
her phone to her head, yelling some nonsense. Security showed up and I told them I was
injured. Then I waited around for police to arrive.
When police arrived, they spoke with the driver first, then walked over and arrested me, they
didn’t take my statement, officers were very dismissive, I told them repeatedly I needed
medical attention. I asked and they refused to give me the drivers car insurance information, in
a mocking tone they told me to go to her address on fuller st in chicopee to get it. After being
released from jail and writing 'denied medical attention' on my release paperwork, I wrote a
statement with my left hand while I was in the emergency room and then I had my accountant,
who also worked 3rd shift, notarize this statement before handing it to an Ada the morning
after this incident, when I went to court for the first time. I also reported those officers denying
me medical attention to the first ADA I met, since I wrote about it in my notarized statement.

Attorney Banks Page 3 of 14
That ada gave me a black and white copy of my police report. I thought this was all a big
misunderstanding, so I agreed to represent myself.
Then during the next pretrial hearing, I had changed my mind about a lawyer, now I wanted
one, but different ada Katherine Johnston talked me out of one by telling me that I was going to
have to wait around until the end of the day, this was after I told her my shoulder, neck and
ankle were killing me and I wasn't on any medication, she told me this situation wasn’t a big
deal, I really didn’t need a lawyer. It’s just a formality. I could leave early if I agreed to go to trial
without a lawyer or I could be waiting around until the end of the day. so I agreed to represent
myself. When I learned of my injuries, I dropped copies of my injury reports off at the DA's
office right after leaving my drs appointments downtown. I requested the drivers car insurance
info and cell phone records, ADA Katherine Johnston said she'd get it for me. I reported
officers denying me medical attention to ADA Johnston and told her about it being in my
notarized statement.
I was very worried after learning about my new injuries, since I was already on workers comp
when this accident took place and didn't have a clue why I felt the way I did, so I went
downtown and filed a complaint against those arresting officers in what I was told to be a
department run by citizens on Maple St in Springfield, but I spoke to an officer. I knew before I
went down there that I received a torn rotator cuff and nerve damage in my right arm from that
incident. I had wanted those officers reprimanded for denying me medical attention and
refusing to give me the drivers insurance information.
Months after that Walmart incident, I went to trial without a lawyer, right before it started, ada
Johnston and ada Edward Kivari both came up to me and told me that judge Hadley said I
couldn’t have that drivers car insurance information or phone records, ( I had wanted the phone
records to prove she was on the phone when she hit me, not paying attention), they also said
this case was about wether I attacked her on purpose or not, not if I was injured at all. Before
trial judge Hadley said that my jury was sent home by accident. I agreed to have a trial by
judge and I was found guilty, placed on probation and ordered to go to anger management. I
was also ordered to come back 10 days later for restitution, because they didn’t have the
receipt or know the total for the window. but Judge Hadley did say I am owed a copy of the
invoice.
*Attorney Banks stopped me here and asked , they went to trial without having the receipt or
knowing the total? I said yes
When I went back to court ada Katherine Johnston boldly professed that the driver paid $311
for this window out of her own pocket. At this hearing judge Hadley again denied me the
drivers auto insurance info, he said it was a civil matter. after the hearing, ada Johnston refused
to give me a copy of the invoice, she said it had the drivers insurance info on it and judge
Hadley had denied me it.
None of this seemed right to me, so I used court lawyer services, then contacted attorney
Randy Milo to look into filing a motion for a new trial, which he did and attorney Eric
Applebaum to deal with the medical/car insurance side , since workers comp was only
handling my work related injuries. They shared an office in Springfield. They both claimed they
were unable to get me a copy of that window invoice.
After attorney Milo filed that motion, I received a letter in the mail saying that driver didn't have
car insurance at the time she hit me. I tried telling my probation officer Janet Ely, but she didn't
know who to report such a thing to, neither attorneys Milo or Applebaum claimed to know who

Attorney Banks Page 4 of 14
to report this to or how to handle it. They were unable to explain why police left that driver
being uninsured off of my police report.
I was then called into court because I hadn't started anger management, I was informed I
should've received a reply to the motion for a new trial already, but it wasn't mailed, I took that
opportunity to give judge Hadley that insurance reply and he read it, then said he couldn't read
it without the ADA there and then went into the backroom with my probation officer. I was
allowed to leave without being reprimanded
I received a reply to the complaint I filed on Maple st and saw that investigating officer left my
documented injuries off of that report and lied about what was said when I was released from
police custody, he claimed I asked for medical attention like an idiot, when I wrote denied
medical attention on my release paperwork and was threatened with being held until morning.
Then I called the Springfield police department and spoke with the chief for almost an hour, he
couldn't help with those officers denying me medical attention or the fact that girl didn't have
insurance and officers left that off my police report or that officer on Maple st ignoring my
documented medical injures in my complaint, the chief seemed confused and uninterested.
I used lawyer services again and contacted Attorney Anna Levine to attempt filing an appeal for
my case, she couldn't get that window invoice either and didn't know how to handle that
drivers lack of insurance or police denying me medical attention or leaving that drivers
insurance status off my police report. She said appeals don’t cover the Brady disclosure and
wasn’t sure if it was a violation.
So I went down to the mayors office and filed a complaint. I wrote the ACLU, the attorney
general, the governors office, I called the FBI and state police, no one could help.
Attorney Levine was never able to obtain the audio from my trial when Judge Hadley told me
my jury was sent home by accident, She also failed to obtain audio from the hearing I went to
for failing to start anger management , but she did get me other hearings and had them
transcribed.
A year after that Walmart incident, I noticed that driver kept driving past my house and I was
receiving threatening texts telling me to stop looking into that case, so I filed a harassment
order against her, on my way to the harassment order extension hearing I was attacked, there
should've been video from the Napa auto parts store a building 400 ft from where I was
attacked, but it was never investigated. the extension was denied
I filed another motion and went before judge Hadley and the comments he made while talking
about that car insurance issue and the faces he was making towards ADA Johnston inspired
me to keep looking.
After that I discovered my notarized statement was altered and I also learned that driver had
rejection sticker for safety and was able to take a picture of the courts copy in the docket with
my phone. I learned that driver had a sister working in the DA’s office, I also learned that driver
lived on the street I was attacked on, she lived 500ft from me this whole time.

Attorney Banks Page 5 of 14
Again I tried reporting this to the District Attorneys office, Jon Gay in the clerks office, the
Mayor, the Governor, the attorney generals office, the ACLU, the FBI, Springfield police and
state police.
This time State police gave me copies of paperwork that showed that drivers suspended
license, no insurance, suspended registration and rejection sticker for safety. She was still
driving around illegally, I tried reporting this to the Springfield police and DA’s office, even with
this physical proof, no one cared, it was ignored.
I received a response to the motion I filed in the mail and I even tried to complain about it to the
courts, because it ignored the insurance company questions I had again, I requested a different
judge since I had asked judge Hadley about this insurance issue multiple times and he tried to
claim it was a civil matter. In the meantime used this motion paperwork to get CJIS login in
verification. This proved officers looked up that drivers registration info and let her drive away
illegally.
Shortly after I received a letter about a court date for forgery and thought it was concerning my
altered statement being looked into, I didn't have a clue it was about the order judge Hadley
sent to me or that the order was fake. So I kept looking for more evidence against the driver
and ADA, that's when I discovered that receipt the ADA Johnston so boldly professed was paid
for was in fact a fake, it was never paid for and the price was raised from its original $245 to
$311.
I raced back to court with the original unaltered receipt, I spoke again with ADA Edward Kivari
outside the district Attorneys office and told him about that drivers lack of insurance,
suspended registration, rejection sticker for safety, police aiding and abetting, the altered
police report, my altered notarized statement, police denying me medical attention. I handed
him copies of the real receipt and a statement from the window company manager stating the
window was never paid for. ADA Kivari seemed confused and couldn't offer advice.
I then asked attorney Anna Levine to speak with then DA Mark Mastrioni and he offered
nothing.
* I asked attorney banks about that charge still being a felony because the original price for the
window before being altered was under $300, he said anything over $250 is a felony, I told him
it was under $250, he said he didn’t know, he’d need to see the docket. So I continued.
Attorney Levine couldn’t offer any advice on the altered evidence, a Brady disclosure violation
or who to report this to, she only knew how to handle appeals and none of this fit she claimed.
I spoke with Jon gay again in the clerks office and he was clueless as to how to report
anything, I asked about this being a conflict of interest because of the altered evidence on my
docket and the driver having family in the da's office, he said wouldn't look into anything or
point me in the right direction.
I then had that hearing I thought was about my altered statement and learned that I was
charged with forgery and I was appointed attorney Nolan to fight this charge, he thought the
evidence I collected against the Springfield police was the greatest, but he was forced to
withdraw due to a conflict of interest, that’s when I was appointed attorney Elaine Pourinski
and she had a private investigator look into the claims I made. the investigator confirmed what
I discovered about my notarized statement being altered, the one in the docket was missing
the pages about police denying me medical attention and them telling me the drivers home

Attorney Banks Page 6 of 14
address, he confirmed the window receipt that ada Johnston presented was a fake and had a
different price than the one that was faxed to her old insurance company. He confirmed that
the prosecution had color photos and they showed the red rejection sticker for safety, but they
only ever provided me with with black and white copy as is their policy. he confirmed the
drivers insurance and inspection sticker status was deleted off of my police report, he
confirmed the driver has a sister who works in the DA's office and a cousin who works in the
clerks office. He confirmed the investigator on Maple st lied in his report, leaving off my
documented injuries and that I had signed my release paperwork with Denied medical
attention.
*Again I asked if this was a conflict of interest, since I went down to the courthouse and told
everyone all of the evidence I found, I thought I could trust the courts and that driver had two
family members there helping her. attorney Banks didn’t know.
It was around this time that I started having suicidal ideation, due to undiagnosed
hyperthyroidism and being misdiagnosed and prescribed medication for issues I didn’t have.
My attorney Pourinski knew all about this and after trying to kill myself in October 2015, she
tried to get me to plead to a CWF, she knew I was a mess, the judge we went before denied it.
Then after I tried to kill myself for the 3rd time, I had a gun placed to my forehead and my files
taken from me by some stranger in the hallway right outside attorney Pourinski’s office in
Northampton on our final visit, she then coerced me into pleading guilty, she knew I didn’t
forge that document and she knew I wanted to fight this and use the evidence I had already
gathered against the district attorney’s office and Springfield police department, but she
convinced me there was no hope, she knew I was suicidal and refused to help me expose what
happened. She convinced me she was also worried about her safety and I should be worried
about my families and that I shouldn’t call police to report what happened. I agreed to plead
guilty in exchange for probation. Before pleading, we spoke with the superior court ada in the
hallway outside the courtroom and I was told what the judge wanted me to say, I plead guilty,
but didn’t say what I was supposed to, the judge made pissy faces, but still accepted my plea,
attorney Pourinski told me after trial that I was lucky the judge didn’t toss me in prison, she
was very angry.
After trial while filing out my probation paperwork, I tried telling the probation officer I was
coerced into pleading guilty, I begged the woman to tell me the names anyone I could contact
who would listen, I told her I recently had a gun placed to my forehead, I begged for a number
to anyone at all that I could report this to, she was unable to help me.
I was then sent to Worcester for probation because I had moved and again I tried reporting
what happened to the probation guy I was appointed, he was clueless and I tried reporting this
to the court appointed therapist they assigned me in Worcester. I asked them many times who I
could report this stuff to and no one could help. I attempted to file charges in chicopee but was
ignored.
And then I met you.
* I told Attorney Banks
I met Beth September of that year, while I was still on probation. The first night I met her she
told me all about her issues with her son being assaulted and how having him so far away has
been a horrifying experience and I told her everything about my court issues and suicide
attempts.

Attorney Banks Page 7 of 14
* I told attorney Banks, I had again asked my ex Beth to give me a some time to stretch my
neck, I told her I had a migraine, but she wanted to keep talking right then and there. Beth was
very insistent.
Beth then questioned me about an email I had been working on for her son, I had sent it out a
couple days before, but she had been working and we didn’t have time to talk about it before
that morning, she had been passing out early because hadn’t been sleeping well, not that she
ever slept well, she had nightmares every night, tossing and sounding like she was in a panic in
her sleep.
*I explained to attorney Banks that Beth had me write and respond to all emails regarding her
son Stephen. Beth found dealing with her sons group home workers and state managers to be
overwhelming. Even her ex husband Patrick Nichols agreed that having me write emails was a
good idea, people didn’t listen to either of them and lied to them all the time. this allowed us to
keep track.
Again I told Beth that something about all this stuff with her son was nagging at me and I
couldn’t figure it out. So she told me start at the beginning like always.
When we first met your son was locked in a psych ward 2 hours away in New Hampshire, even
though there were psych wards much closer, state workers even threatened to claim you
abandoned him there in their attempts to force you to place him in a setting you found unsafe.
Drs and state workers lied to you about your sons behaviors and drs at this hospital kept him
heavy sedated while there.
Then he moves to Crystal Springs and they to lie to our faces too. Rich Mancini shook my hand
and promised to make home visits a regular thing, he promised mall and park outings. He said
these things in front of you and they were bold faced lies.
Crystal Springs asl tried to keep him drugged instead of trying to communicate with him.
Staff would ignore him and close his door, knowing it upsets him, then one time when he
busted the cheap door down. Crystal springs tried to use this as an excuse to drug him,
instead of following his iep and trying to communicate with him.
They tried to force us to take restraint training, when I decided it was time for us to start taking
Stephen out on our own.
Then Rich Mancini calls to threatens to have your son sent to the emergency room, because
we refused to allow them to toss him in the closet anymore, they used the closet instead of
following his IEP.
*I told Banks I was disgusted they were constantly restraining her son and failing to document
it.
Rich Mancini claimed the company couldn’t take your son to the hospital after you arrived for a
surprise visit and discovered a large swollen area on his face. Staff had no explanation and
there was no documentation, so I drove 2 hours both ways to help both bring him to get
checked by drs.

Attorney Banks Page 8 of 14
Then he gets dumped at KDC, those staff loved watching violent rap videos with us there, they
talked about the Florida of the North and staff used his Netflix account to watch violent movies,
not the Disney type he actually likes, they lie about taking him for walks and then there are the
undocumented injures, visible infections on his hands with zero explanation. Companies
change and Amigo also lies about making home visits a thing and Stephen started getting
mystery handprints on his arm, his old manager from the house he was abused at years ago,
started working with him, this Craig Robinson told me about the abuse that happened at his
previous company and he was the only person your son ever reacted panicky around, Craig
looked the other way when he started jumping up and down, making loud vocalizations I've
never witnessed this behavior before and he glared right at Craig the whole time.
When we tried to get him transferred to another home, the state workers lied about who owns
these homes, it sounded like a real-estate fraud scheme, since public records didn't match
what they were saying.
We file multiple claims of abuse and neglect, we finally get him to a closer house and the
problems just seem to get worse and I told her this new house also seemed like a problem that
needed to be addressed asap.
Beth agreed and we talked about the current issues going on in her sons new home. They were
understaffed and poorly trained staff. Clients were happy when we he first moved in, but that
changed and program managers said these guys do that, which we thought was bullshit, staff
were always on their phones, the bathroom was disgusting with a scum layer covering the
walls.
Beth didn’t understand what I meant about what was bothering me, outside of the normal
issues we were always dealing with. Beth was worked up because she just learned while we
were talking that morning that her sons new house manager was fired, this women was going
help us expose the abuse and neglect going on inside Beth’s sons current home placement.
This lady said she was doing the job cause she said she loved it, not cause she needed the
money.
So I told Beth about the email I had sent.
I told Banks one of their program managers had lied to our faces about getting staff to take her
son for walks and they also never arranged home visits. I gave him the basics on the email
since mine was missing. I assume Beth deleted mine since she still had access to my laptop
for weeks.
One day we went to visit her son and assemble a bureau, a program manager was there and I
spoke with her about taking her son on walks, this woman said they needed two staff, I asked
how she was going to make this happen when there’s only two or three staff working with 5
guys? She said not to worry about it, they’re hiring staff. I asked her to contact us weekly and
I’ll personally come take him for walks of they can’t, she said that wouldn’t be necessary, again
I questioned her about staff, she said they haven’t hired anyone yet. So I asked how they were
going to make this happen anytime soon, she said it'll happen.
During this same visit Beth was downstairs with her son, she had previously bought a tv tray
for her son to eat his meals on, because another resident was violent at the kitchen table, but
staff took his tv tray for themselves, this happened while we were both there. Her son had a

Attorney Banks Page 9 of 14
dinner plate on his lap. Beth was horribly upset, her hands were shaking, the program manager
had to speak with staff about appropriate behavior. There was also the incident where her sons
FaceTime was turned on and left pointing at the ceiling for two hours without any staff
interacting with him at all, but I could hear yelling, pounding and grunting coming from another
part of the house. It wasn’t from a television. Beth wanted all of this documented and
addressed asap, she seemed frustrated that it took me longer than normal to write that email.
*I told attorney Banks that this stuff was really weighing on my mind that morning, but Beth
was the one getting herself all fired up, more so than I felt was needed
We didn’t know what to do next, we tried and failed many times attempting at reporting the
abuse and neglect to DDS, the DPPC, the state and local police, calling the disability law
center.
I told Banks I tried to change the subject to scrappy’s (Beth's dog) upcoming dental
appointment and Beth brought up driving arrangements. That’s when I told Beth about my Dad
stopping me on my way in the night before and told me he didn’t want to getting another car,
he said he didn’t want the driveway looking like a parking lot. Beth seemed very upset by this,
she told me that she was going to buy me a car and she was going to speak to my father,
which just sounded like she wanted to argue with someone to me.
*I explained to attorney Banks that Beth had been keeping track of all the hours I helped her
with her son and all the miles put on my car visiting her son, I also let Beth use my car for work
and it was damaged, so she was going to reimburse me, the total was around $10,000 at that
point.
I told Beth I didn’t want her speaking to my father, that we don’t have the money for a car
accessible at the moment, so I don’t want to start a fight over something that isn’t even
possible. Beth got very frustrated cause she really wanted me to be able to head of to her sons
house and make surprise visits to keep an extra eye on her son.
Beth then said she wanted to talk about her daughters boyfriend sleeping over, which I
responded, she just moved in and we agreed to live here under my dads rules.
It was at this point I told Beth I’m done talking, I wanted to leave, that I wasn’t going to be
around to start trouble with people, that the things she says to people always comes back on
me.
*I told attorney Banks how my dad gave me discount on rent, at this time I was paying our rent,
electric and phone bills, Beth paid for our food and her car.
I got up to grab my things so I could leave. Beth followed me into our dining room and kept
trying to tell me things, but I told her I’m done.
Then Beth started saying “if you’re so unhappy then hit me”. I told her grow up, I can’t take this
anymore. Beth tried to get in my way as I grabbed my medication and placed it in my
backpack, she was acting childish and trying to prevent me from gathering my dogs heart
worm and her toothbrush. I told Beth this is why no one wants to help you. I told her I’m

Attorney Banks Page 10 of 14
leaving, you can have the apartment. Then once my backpack was ready, I went upstairs to
change my clothes, since it was cold and rainy out.
Beth followed me upstairs into our middle bedroom and closed the door behind us. While I was
changing, I told her to move out of the way multiple times and she kept saying " No I'll call the
cops if you try to move me". She tried telling me something else, but I wasn’t listening to
anything she said. This went on for a half hour, she refused to move, she threatened me
multiple times, saying she’d call the cops on me if I moved her, she said she’d tell them I hit
her. I repeatedly told Beth you can’t do this stuff to people, this is why no one wants to help
you. She continued this childish behavior and when I couldn't take anymore, I told her “I’ll
scream for help, I haven’t heard anything you were talking about, I stopped listening after you
threatened to call the cops”. She got this deranged look on her face and said “I am gonna call
the cops and tell them you hit me, I’ll never stop, I hope you do kill yourself this time.”
*Banks asked if Beth ever mocked me like that before? I told him no, this was the first time she
ever said she hoped I killed myself. I told Banks Beth's daughter Olivia was in the bedroom
next to the one we were in, I wasn't fighting or arguing with Beth, I just wanted to get away
from her.
After hearing that, I picked up my dog Harley and told Beth to “get the fuck out of my way”,
she opened the door and walked out, then she stood in front of the stairs for a moment, almost
like she was going to try blocking my way again, hoping I'd push her down the stairs. but then
she moved aside, allowed to go downstairs, she followed behind me. As I was putting Harley’s
harness on, Beth snatched my backpack and refused to give it back.
•Banks asked what else in my backpack, I told him my FPV drove setup, telescopic fishing pole
and lures, my knee, elbow and ankle braces, phone charger, poncho. I told him I took it with
me every time I left the house.
Beth mocked me as she held my backpack, saying she’ll never pay me back, again saying that
if I walk out that door she hopes I do kill myself, she said she hopes police hurt me and put me
in the hospital.
I told her this is why no one wants to help you, you act like a child and purposely try to upset
people when you don’t get your way. I told Beth she has no right to do these things to people
after they’ve helped her and still have the nerve to expect them to listen to anything she has to
say.
I told Beth I hope the police do hurt me, cause I’m never going to help you ever again.
Again she told me she’ll never pay me back, good luck getting a job. I said whatever, you have
to no right to try to trap me here. You’re just desperate to be a victim.
She grabbed my second set of headphones that I kept hanging on a kitchen hook and was
dangling my backpack as if she wanted me to try grabbing them from her. She was in the
middle of kitchen and I was in the dining room, I walked towards her in the kitchen, I told her to
give me my backpack, then she walked towards the front door and I took that opportunity to
escape out the backdoor with my dog Harley.
**Banks asked again if elbowed her on the way out. I told him no, and told him that Sue and
Olivia would’ve heard our dogs go crazy if I had hit Beth. plus Beth has a laundry list of

Attorney Banks Page 11 of 14
physical issues, if I had assaulted her in any way, she would’ve aggravated something, she
definitely would’ve raced to the hospital.
* I told attorney Banks that I thought all of this stuff she's been through had finally gotten to her
and I thought she needed a mental health evaluation.
*Attorney Banks asked if Beth ever did this before and I said yes, I told him about a time about
6 months before, Beth had tried holding me in our bedroom when no one was around. I tried
walking by her and she became all dramatic, she claimed I brushed into her as I tried to sneak
by and she said she’d call the cops if I left. She even told people about it. I didn’t believe she’d
actually do it, the first time seemed more like she was panicking.
•Banks said he wants a list and would contact my witnesses and get statements about what
Beth said to them about holding me in that room.
•Attorney Banks asked what happened with police. I told him that I agreed to continue
speaking to police after they read me my rights and told him what details I shared with them.
Banks told me that was a terrible idea, he told me the less I say the better.
*Banks said he would request the body cam footage.
*I asked Banks why officers didn’t charge Beth for what she did to me, he said officers
probably didn’t want to make things worse, since their report doesn’t indicate any injuries, Beth
denied needing medical treatment and officers didn’t take any pictures, plus I told Banks that
Beth had these previous medical issues, why weren’t any of them aggravated.
*Banks said he would request a copy of Beth’s medical records.
*I told Banks how lucky I felt that I wasn’t injured by police. That Beth was well aware that I’m
disabled because of a genetic skeletal muscle disorder and I’ve had over a dozen orthopedic
joint surgeries, she said she hoped officers would hurt me.
Again I asked about having Beth charged for holding me against my will, stealing my backpack
and threatening to use police to hurt me. Banks said it was up to officers if they found probable
cause. I asked banks if this was assault, since Beth made threats of having police hurt me, or if
it was aiding and abetting since police officers followed her commands and ignored my safety
and well-being. he just shrugged.
I told banks that just because officers were gentle with me, didn’t mean that what they were
doing couldn’t have caused me serious physical harm. My shoulder and neck were cramping at
the time of my arrest and I had a horrible migraine. Banks told me that the laws were changed
so that people could be arrested for assault and battery without any evidence to support the
claim, all because citizens complained that people in power got away with physically abusing
their loved ones, he gave an example of some baseball player I’ve never heard of beating his
wife and not being arrested.
I asked Banks if the police could be charged with assault and battery and kidnapping for doing
as Beth commanded and not charging her for what she did to me? he said no, it's a judgement
call on their part.

Attorney Banks Page 12 of 14
I told attorney Banks about Beth Lying during our restraining order extension hearing October
14, 2021, she claimed my father said she could have our apartment and I wasn’t allowed back
and that she said there was a history of abuse. Which was a boldfaced lie.
Attorney Banks said he would send a request to the ada to obtain the court recording from that
day and he would get a statement from my father and that I shouldn’t speak to him about this
incident.
Attorney Banks also said the court recording and body cam footage had to come from the
district attorney’s office and he would request it all.
I also made Attorney Banks aware of a 911 alert I received from Beth’s son Stephens phone on
October 24,2021, I showed him a picture of the alert and a picture of the bruises a staff
member inflicted upon her son at one point. Beth's son was living in a group home for the
mentally challenged at this time and I was really concerned for his safety and well-being.
Attorney Banks dismissed my concerns and laughed, he said he gets reports of disabled
people being abused in this home all the time and told me that he has a client at that very
address. He continued laughing when talking about the guy who got naked and would slam his
fists down on the kitchen table when dinner wasn’t served on time. He also spoke about
different abuse allegations that Beth and I weren’t made aware of, back when I was still
supposed to be alerted, staff were caught yelling at clients, clients had mystery bruises, I
asked what I could do about the 911 alert I received or past abuse reports I filed, attorney
Banks said nothing, He told me not to worry about it, it’s not my concern anymore. I asked
about the past abuse reports I filed on her sons behalf, Banks just shrugged.
Attorney Banks assured me I had nothing to worry about because police didn’t take this
seriously, police didn't take my statement, police didn't take any pictures of Beth’s alleged
injuries, police didn’t take statements from anyone else in the house at the time. He noted that
Beth didn’t seek medical attention. He said we were just going through the motions, the laws
have changed, it's nothing personal.
*I asked Attorney Banks who I could report ada Johnston for tampering with evidence, and
altering notarized statements to, he said the DA’s office can alter evidence if it indicates
another crime, he said he would have to see my court docket.
* I asked attorney banks if an ada withholding the fact the driver was committing a crime at the
time of this alleged incident was a violation of the Brady disclosure? He wasn’t sure.
*I asked attorney Banks if it was aiding and abetting when officers allowed that driver to drive
away illegally? he wasn't sure
* I asked banks about the missing insurance info on the police report, shouldn't police be
required to notify people in accidents of drivers without insurance and rejection stickers for
safety? he said he wasn’t sure.
* I asked attorney banks about this being a Conflict of interest because that drivers sister
worked in the DA's office. He didn’t know

Attorney Banks Page 13 of 14
* I asked Banks who I could report being coerced into pleading guilty in superior court, he said
he didn't know how things were done in superior court.
Before I left his office, attorney Banks agreed again to request the body cam and warren
booking footage since police didn’t document me giving my statement,
He told me he would send a request to the DA’s office for the October 14, 2021 restraining
order audio, he said it would help my case to prove that Beth lied about things my father said
to her, that Beth was trying to create conflict within my family.
Banks told me all evidence requests had to go through the da’s office so it could take a while.
I reminded Banks that the emails I sent on Beth’s sons behalf were no longer in my yahoo
account said he would send in a request to subpoena Beth’s emails to the state.
I told Banks I wanted my trial asap, he told me I have to wait a year, Beth has to be given time
to drop the charges.
I told Banks that Beth would never stop, she said it herself, she really hopes I'll get stressed
out over all of this and kill myself. You didn’t see the look in her eyes, I'd never seen Beth like
that before, she looked like she lost it.
Banks told me he would request money for an investigator to speak Sue and Olivia, because
they were in the house that day, he also said speaking to the people Beth bragged about
holding me against my will the first time and then claiming I bumped into her while trying to get
by, would be good for my case and showed a pattern of behavior for Beth.
He thought it would be a good idea for the investigator speak to Beth’s coworkers, after I told
him we used to work together traveling to different Big Y’s to set up new products and Beth
currently worked at Big Y in Palmer with her daughter and people we know.
He also wanted statements about Beth owing me $10,000 as a possible motive for lying. along
with the fact Olivia just moved in a week before and how Beth lied during our restraining order
hearing about my Dad saying she could have our apartment and I wasn't allowed back.
In court April, 4, 2022 Attorney Banks told me he received the 911 call audio and that body
cam footage, but hadn’t finished listening to it, , he mentioned Beth denying the need for
medical attention, he ask me why I was so worried about my dog. He wanted to listen to the
entirety, then set up a date and time to listen to it together. Banks asked me why I kept talking
after being arrested, again I reminded him about the stuff that happened to me in Hampden
county district court. attorney Banks still hadn’t requested money for an investigator like he
agreed to do, so I called him out on it, I told him my father is still waiting to be questioned.
Banks got mad and gabbed his finger in my face telling me not to tell him how to do his job.
Banks requested the money for an investigator at this pretrial hearing, he said he would get the
investigator to question people right away.
At our next pretrial date June 23, 2022, Banks claimed something came up and handed me a
paper with a new court date and left.

Attorney Banks Page 14 of 14
During the next pretrial conference September 20, 2022 I asked Banks what was going on and
if he was going to do any of the things he agreed he would do and where that body cam
footage was, he acted confused and said he’d make a request me to get a new lawyer, since I
didn’t seem happy with his job performance. The judge accepted his requested to withdraw
and implied that I couldn’t handle the truth, when I tried to speak up about attorney Banks
behavior and failure to follow through on things we agreed he would do, but the judge wasn’t
interested.


2022

Nothing yet, 

But I should get the audio from East Brookfield I can show that that female judge said that I can’t handle the truth after I accused Attorney Banks of not doing his job any jabbed his finger in my face when I called him out on not doing the things he said he was going to do and he shook my hand and said he was gonna do them



2023

Here's from Doherty, he is a scumbag, a real scumbag and I think the public is going to get to learn that.
Attorney O'Doherty Page 1 of 5
I was appointed Attorney O'Doherty without explanation, on March 16 ,2023 we spoke at
length about the things that happened with Beth October 4, 2021, our relationship, the things I
told police after being arrested and what I talked to attorney Banks about.
Attorney O'Doherty was very excited when I told him how Beth visually appeared when she
said that she hopes I do kill myself this time and she wanted the police to hurt me. He said he
wanted to use those statements against her at trial.
He was also very excited about Beth owing me $10,000 and her comments about not paying
me, since I told him that there were references to this in our emails to her sons group home
managers and state area directors and Beth also told my family and friends. These emails also
covered Beth wanting me to become co-guardian to her son. O'Doherty said he would use a
rule 17 to subpoena those records and have the investigator question my list of people about
her remarks.
O'Doherty also spoke to me about pursuing a harassment order because of the things Beth
posted online, he said it would help my defense, I choose not to, I just wanted to go to trial. He
said he would have an investigator document the things Beth posted online for my trial.
O'Doherty wanted me to focus on Beth holding me in that middle bedroom and her owing me
money, he wanted me to ignore the things we talked about that led to her actions. I told him I
couldn’t do that.
I told O'Doherty I've been back on thyroid medication and my perspective had changed
I told O'Doherty that my refusing to listen to Beth is what set her off that morning. In the days
leading up to this alleged assault, I showered Beth with affection, we weren’t having
relationship issues, our relationship was great. whenever Beth did get upset, it was always
because of the abuse and neglect going on in her sons group homes or when staff would lie to
her and she felt helpless to do anything about it. Every night Beth had nightmares and she
would toss and turn because of the torment this caused her, she talked about it every day. plus
she was extra upset about her sons house manager being fired that morning. She was pushing
for me to become her sons co-guardian to help her with all of this and I ran off.
I told O'Doherty I wasn’t going to try making Beth out to be a monster, I wanted her to get help,
O'Doherty was disgusted by my responses, he couldn’t seem to understand why I felt like I
caused Beth’s severe emotional distress that day or why I want to tell the whole story. I
explained again to him, I had gone out of my way for Beth and her son since the day I met her.
She had no explanation as to why I ran off in such a bizarre way and without running my big
mouth trying to explain myself, I just ignored her, which I'd never done ever before, she was
hoping I'd argue with her and I didn't.
Plus I agreed with her that morning when she claimed I wasn't happy, even though that wasn't
true, I just wanted to get away from her at that moment. I was worried about dealing with my
father not wanting me to get a car and this stuff with the court and her sons group homes also
seemed like an impossible task. it was causing me to have a panic attack and I had a migraine
from a cramp in my neck, it felt like my right eye was going to pop out of my head. I just

Attorney O'Doherty Page 2 of 5
wanted to lay down, not confront people about their remarks or get into physical altercations
with anyone.
I told him Beth had never seen me overwhelmed by anything before, I had always been super
arrogant.
Especially when talking about dealing with the state and lawyers, I approached dealing with her
sons group home workers and state contacts with excitement and enthusiasm, I was never
overwhelmed by any of it.
I told him I wouldn't have told Beth the things I did that morning, if I wasn't sick, she asked me
what people said about her and I told her. I wouldn't have responded the same way either, so I
can understand why she was so upset.
Plus Beth probably believed I wasn’t happy since I was experiencing erectile disfunction again,
so I'm sure that didn't help things.
I told O'Doherty how it took months to get back on thyroid medication and felt lucky I didn’t kill
myself because of all the stress this situation caused me and my family and the lack of concern
shown for my safety and well-being this entire time. I told him I wrote myself an email in
October of 2021 to remind myself of details I thought I might forget, and I sound like a whiny
baby complaining about things that never worried me before. It was shocking to see how
whiney I sounded in that email.
I asked if the warren police could be charged with kidnapping, since I told them what Beth said
and they didn’t document my statement. He just wanted to focus on my defense. I countered,
wouldn’t this help my defense, he wasn’t sure.
I asked who I could report being coerced into pleading guilty to, O'Doherty said that I should
file a motion for a new trial with the malicious damage to motor vehicle case and this coerced
confession will come out because of this.
before I left O'Doherty Agreed to do these things.
1. Attorney O'Doherty said he would make a written request for the warren body cam footage
since it was missing from the file attorney Banks gave him, he said it would help to use what I
said to police that morning against Beth at trial, he said her emotional state didn't matter.
2. Attorney O'Doherty also agreed he would have an investigator speak to the witnesses I
listed, since attorney Banks didn’t, he agreed that Beth holding me against my will and
threatening to call the police on me in the past, shows a pattern of behavior and that I didn’t
actually believe she’d call and say something like that. plus Beth told these people she owed
me money and wanted me to become her sons co-guardian, so I could deal with the issues
she was having with the state. He also wanted statements from Sue and Olivia because there

Attorney O'Doherty Page 3 of 5
was no noise in the house, or physical altercation that upset set our dogs, I had explained they
would go crazy if we play fought. Sue would've complained about the noise. We were talking,
not arguing or fighting. he agreed that ending a conversation isn't hostile or aggressive in any
way.
3. O'Doherty said he'd make a written request for Beth's medical records because of the preexisting injuries she has.
4. O'Doherty said he would use a rule 17 to request emails I sent on Beths' sons behalf, since
these showed that Beth wanted me to become her sons co-guardian and owed me $10,000 to
pay me back.
5. O'Doherty said he would make a written request to obtain my restraining order audio.
O'Doherty told me I should file a motion for a new trial, that it would look good for my case and
that the things I told him should be addressed, so I went down March 17, 2023 and filed, this
motion was denied, judge Hadley claimed I made bold allegations.
 *********************
The first trial date I was given was May 24, 2023, attorney O'Doherty arrived totally unprepared,
I asked him what was going on. He asked if I trusted him, which I replied No, since he said he
didn’t gathered any of the evidence he agreed to obtain, he didn't request the body cam
footage, he didn’t have an investigator speak to anyone to gather statements or invite any
witnesses to speak at my trial, he didn’t get copies of the emails I sent, all things he himself
said would help my case. I told him I was completely in the dark about what was going on and
wanted to speak to the judge before trial, I told him “I already told you what happened with my
previous trials where evidence was altered and presented as fact by ada Johnston and I was
coerced into pleading guilty after having a gun placed to my forehead and trying to commit
suicide 3 times. I'm lucky I got back on thyroid medication when I did, I’m not going to allow
any more games. ”. He smiled at me and said he'll be back, went into the courtroom alone,
saying I had to wait outside and he cancelled my trial, then rushed out of the courtroom he said
he has to leave and court is now May 26th in Worcester, without slowing down, he ran out of
the courthouse, leaving me with zero explanation. leaving me even more confused than before.

The court date tomorrow is a trial assignment date. It is not a trial date.
Held on the fourth floor room
23 9:00
It does not seem you have confidence in my representation.
Accordingly I will be making a motion to withdraw as there is a breakdown in the
attorney/ client relationship.
A new attorney will be appointed.

I'm confused as to what is going on.
You told me that we were going to trial Wednesday; but vou can into court totally unprepared
and never provided me with any of the information I asked you about.
I was told that my case was going to be investigated by Attorneys Banks, Dicato and yourself.
We all agreed on who to talk to and what information to gather.
As far as I am aware, nothing was ever looked into. I was granted a court order for money to
investigate my statements.
Once I mentioned being coerced into pleading guilty in my last court case and that it was
because I found evidence that the commonwealth created fake evidence in a previous case.

Attorney O'Doherty Page 5 of 5
Every lawyer I talk to get scared and stops communicating with me.
Beth and I talked about it all the time and she was pushing me to fight my coerced confession
and they malicious damage case, that the commonwealth created fake evidence in.
Beth wanted me to be co guardian for he son, because she was tired of the
commonwealth lying and not doing anything about her son being abused.
That last day, she told me she hopes I kill myself this time and laughed that she was going to
call the police and no one was going to help me.
And it appears she's right
So from now on, I'm going to need to communicate in writing, to prevent any
misunderstandings or confusion on anyone's part

December 23, 2023 tried to get a harassment order against the Worcester County district attorney office and Joe early. They were stalling my case and withholding evidence and acting stupid. When I talk to this judge in Hampton county about it, he said he didn’t know who to contact he was just as confused as everyone else on earth I ask.


December 22, 2023 tried to get a harassment order against the Worcester County district attorney office and Joe early. They were stalling my case and withholding evidence and acting stupid. When I talk to this judge in Hampton county about it, he said he didn’t know who to contact he was just as confused as everyone else on earth I ask.


“This below covers events from a 2023 harassment order hearing. I was targeted by the same system that failed to protect all of us, and here’s the transcript and breakdown.”

Transcription of video by me.

I told the judge that the Worcester County District Attorney's office and Joe early were preventing me from going to trial because I have evidence that Hampton County District Attorney ADA Katherine Johnston and police officer Thomas Sheehan tampered with evidence in my previous case and this was a conversation I was having with my ex the morning That this argument I mean this discussion. This is where the judge interrupted me and asked if those about the case with the Warren Police Department. I explained to the judge that My ex didn't know what was wrong with me I wasn't feeling well and I didn't want to deal with the situation. I told this judge that I didn't know I was sick again and she didn't know it either, she was enraged when I left and I explained to my lawyers what happened in this other case evidence And they explained it to the Worcester County District Attorney's office they told me that I had to to deal with it all in Springfield. even though I don't care about getting these felonies off my case, I even tried to commit suicide because I was so sick and at a case in Superior Court and Coerced me into pleading guilty. and they won't even give me the recordings I've been trying to get the transcripts from that hearing during that hearing I said I don't remember doing it it was less than two weeks after getting out of the psych ward and every time I tried to tell people. And then the judge interrupted me and asked me how I was feeling today. I told him I'm feeling very stressed that I'm still speaking to a therapist I'm talking to my doctors about this a they all said I sound reasonable even though it's affecting me physically and mentally Because I have a skeletal genetic muscle disorder. And the judge tells me he's sorry about that. And I told them that my muscles tighten up when I overexert myself. Judge says can I just tell you that it looks like from your record the case in Warren out of the East Brookfield District Court is scheduled for jury trial January 10th 2000 and 24, I'm sure you're aware of that. And I tell the judge that someone told me it's ATAD and then I'm not supposed to be having trial it's just another And I'm not expected to be there. The judge again says the case says its jt at 62 in Worcester I believe he's trying to indicate it's a jury trial. He said the judge said it started in East Brookfield and it looks like the jury trials transferred to Worcester and that's what he's seeing. I told this judge that the judge I spoke to in Worcester told me I had to come deal with this in Springfield and you can listen to that recording when I said I called the FBI as well. I told this judge that whoever I tell they all want to wash their hands of this and I've got physical evidence and this started 10 years ago and I've been trying to put this behind me and I brought this before Judge Hadley and he said it was bold statements And I told them I have physical evidence a preponderance of evidence. And every step of the way Springfield police tampered with evidence, I went to the civil people on Maple Street and I already had my doctors notes ahead of time and I knew I was injured from that incident and I didn't know that that girl didn't have car insurance or rejections sticker for safety, Her registration was suspended in Springfield officers helped her get away with that and I told his judge that assistant district attorney Katherine Johnson created a fake receipt after my trial and I have proof of that too because the original heat was faxed the day after that incident happened on January 16th and then the district attorney created a fake receipt when I came back because I had to pay the reimbursement for damage for window and the reason her window wasn't covered by the window place is because she didn't have car insurance. I tried to get a harassment order against this woman because she was driving by my house all the time turns out she five houses away And she was driving with no license the entire time she was driving by my house and I called the police and she was able to get a harassment order against me ( because I called the police and reported her, cops agreed it was harassment) I was told that the police have to catch her In the act of driving without insurance and driving without a license you can't call the police and report people even when it has a rejection sticker for safety I said that doesn't make any sense this is totally illegal these people are above the law. And then the hammer came down on me and you made me pay pay for a window that she never paid for and and making me seem like a monster this is all so overwhelming and I put this all online My lawyers like you know what the only way to get away with this is to put it all online now they can't take it away because now I'm not being allowed to go to trial and they don't want to talk about it. This always seems to be somebody else's fault, I had nothing to do with it. I spoke to a district attorney Mark Mastroianni years ago I had appeals lawyer Anna Levine she spoke to him before he became a federal judge and everybody said I don't know what to do , talk to somebody else and sue them civilly. Why do I have to do all this stuff if somebody commits a crime isn't the state responsible for investigating that, what's reported, not just, somebody accuses you of a crime first so. So if I'm watching somebody commit a crime, so I see that guy committing a crime And then they accused me of something that means they're innocent? That doesn't make any sense to me cause I've done nothing, I've never lashed out at these people, when I found out where that girl lived a couple houses away I didn't go over to her I stayed away from her, I stay away from her street I didn't harass her, I never lashed out at her, the Springfield pollution have done that I just wanted the law to admit that they did something wrong. The district attorney's office shouldn't have done that and I can back all of this up and I never would have discovered it I wouldn't keep fighting after what judge Hadley said comments about someone paying for that window. I discovered it a year and a half after the event happened, I found where she got the window fixed and learned that she never paid for it ( you can read ada Johnston lying about in in court transcripts), This doesn't make any sense I swore an oath to tell the truth And they did too and they didn't tell the truth and my biggest stink when this all started is that I was denied medical attention I was walking through a parking lot and got hit by a car years ago and they just brought me to the police station and harassed me like that's ridiculous and then I find out they denied me metal core insurance because she didn't have car insurance and they didn't want to admit that. This stresses me out and I've got a lot to say man. Now if I don't say it in order that's why I put all online, Everyone I see says I say ridiculous too much, Cause I try not to swear and I try to keep myself grounded after being upset, I'm not upset at people about this, this is a broad problem. I'm not going to go after any of these people that have accused me of doing stuff just because my X is mad that I ran off and when they all hear the story of that and why she's stressed out, they say it all makes sense. 

The judge then asked if there's anything else I'd like to tell him, Eventually someone's going to have to look into this and it's not fair to drop it all on you, it's overwhelming and there's nothing you can do about it today so, it's been going on for years. Hopefully once this is done I'm going to point me in the right direction, you can't just have a problem and ignore it forever. Something serious is going on here in any other cases that these people are involved in deserve to be double checked now and I came here and complained years ago to John Gay, this is not like my first rodeo. My lawyer told me now you need go back and stand up because this is happening on other people, I have to stand up not just my myself but for other citizens. For anyone that this happens to this is ridiculous I was supposed to have my trial in Worcester in this Joe early, I wanted it two years ago, I let my ex live next door to my father, In a duplex and she lived forever there after that and he died of cancer and he was one of my witnesses and I still am a statement from him, they refused to get a statement from him All that time about the stuff that happened next door and I make it putting it off and off and I want my trial I deserve a trial. I should have had it two years ago. But nobody wants to answer  hopefully someone will answer to you And I'm hoping they can't just ignore this moving forward.

Judge says OK umm, Then the judge asks who my lawyer is out of Worcester and I tell him Alex Burgo and he asks that this is the first attorney I've had on this case or? I told them This is the 4th I've had Roger Banks , there was another woman for like a week And then a Michael O'doherty. And then the judge asked if those are bar advocates. And I said yes and he said all right.

The judge asked if there's anything else I want to tell the court. Not right now if anybody has any questions I've got paperwork and things online. I've stacked things in order as years ago I was mentally a mess. And things weren't exactly in order but now everything is. 

And then the judge comments, so in treatment and  you're getting and you have your therapist, and I say I didn't know what was wrong with you but now I'm diagnosed my issues, before it was just invisible and nobody knew i had an issue... the judge comment I'm properly getting medication And all of that stuff and I say yes and he says good.

 Then the judge Says here's where I'm at I'll share with you my thoughts on it and hopefully you understand what I'm about to explain to you first and foremost I understand your frustration with wanting a jury trial and having to wait two years for that I'm pretty sure you're not necessarily interested in explanations as to why and I'm sure your lawyers have already told you about COVID and the fact that probably not until the spring of 21 where we really do on jury trial because of COVID and even that was really truncated slow basis, but that having been said this is not what you were talking about just not meet the criteria for harassment order prevention I understand you are trying to build the record and you're very upset with all those things but this is not what a harassment prevention order is for and it's not the right venue for it and it's not the right frankly even court for it but that's beside the point a harassment prevention order is a very narrow type of proceeding focused on a very narrow issue and I say this a lot this court can't solve all the problems people face on these orders so I wish you the best of luck and your application is denied thank you.

And I ask who can I contact is there anyone because when I asked no one knows who to contact. I called the FBI.

The judge into rushed me and says Sir I wish I could give you legal advice on what to do but I cannot I am precluded from doing that um it sounds like sounds to me like your talking about your civil rights are being violated and you need a civil rights attorney and that's the only advice I can give you is that you should talk to a lawyer and you've done that so I'm out of suggestions. 

Even if I accuse somebody of a crime and I present evidence and I put it online nothing can happen, like nothing can happen? If I made a video of me committing a crime and put it online I could be charged but if I accuse somebody else of a crime who investigates that? If I accused the police I can arrest them i'm not the law, like how do I use the law the way it's designed to go out for criminals.

And here the judge interrupts me again and says, I wish I could keep the legal advice but I can't you ask great questions you certainly have concerns but I can't give you legal advice good luck and I say thank you and he says be well stay safe.

(This is an afterthought this is 2025 right now it's may 27th and I'm still disgusted by the laziness and stupidity displayed by these judges they're so corrupt they're so dirty scumbag pieces of trash, I haven't forgotten you guys I'm still coming.)

January 30, 2024 I returned a Worcester District Court for that stupid competency hearing and here's the paperwork I called Alex Virgo a liar and I told that doctor about all the abuse these mentally challenged people are suffering and all the crimes committed against me and she just acted stupid and looked at me like a buffoon.

Here's the statement I used when I filed a complaint against Alex Bergo and contains everything I could remember about this dare bag.
Attorney Bergo Page 1 of 6
I spoke with Attorney Alex Bergo on the phone in June of 2023 before meeting him in his office,
during this call he was adamant that things move forward quickly because of how long my
case has been dragged out. He made it very clear to me that I needed to make sure things
proceed quickly, so I made a special trip in July to speak face to face with him in his Worcester
office.
In his office and I told Bergo the same story I told Attorneys Banks and the expanded details I
told O'Doherty with their responses and how I have been let down by these court appointed
lawyers.
I showed Bergo my text messages with O'Doherty and told him to many lawyers have lied to
me and I just wanted lawyers to do what what they said they’d do.
I explained how I told O'Doherty how I was now back on thyroid medication and felt lucky I
didn’t kill myself because of this situation and the lack of concern for my safety and well-being
this entire time and O'Doherty still tried to pull some kinda sneaky business on my trial date. I
showed Bergo the emails I sent myself and explained the change in my personality.
I asked Bergo if he could explain what attorney O'Doherty had tried to do the day I was
supposed to have trial, what did he say that got my trial date put off? I also showed him the
texts I sent him. Bergo couldn’t answer.
I asked Bergo how district attorneys are allowed to alter and withhold evidence, he said he'd
have to see my files.
Before I left Bergo's office he agreed to do these things,
1. Bergo specifically said he would make a written request to the DA's to acquire warren police
body cam footage that attorney Banks claimed to have received and O'Doherty claimed he
would request.
2. Bergo agreed to have an investigator speak to the witnesses I listed, especially Sue Stebbins
and Olivia Nichols because they were in the house at the time of this alleged incident, to see if
they heard anything and the other people because Beth told them about holding me in our
bedroom in the past, owing me money for a car and wanting me to be her sons co-guardian.
3. Bergo agreed to make a written request for copies of Beth’s medical records to show her
pre-existing injuries weren't aggravated.
4. Bergo agreed to make a written request to obtain copies of the emails I sent on Beth's sons
behalf, to show she owed me money and that she wanted me to become her sons coguardian.
5. Bergo Agreed make a written request to acquire restraining order audio.
I didn’t want Bergo to magically forget, so I wrote a follow up email July 24,2023 after our face
to face meeting, going over much of what we talked about.

Attorney Bergo Page 2 of 6
I received a response to that email on December 1, 2023. In those 4 months between
messages, Bergo made no attempts to gather any of the evidence we agreed he would request
and he failed to have an investigator speak to anyone. He no longer had a sense of urgency.
In this email he claimed he would try to obtain that restraining order recording, the same one I
had asked previous lawyers for, he also never told me how easy it would be to obtain those
recordings myself.
Bergo called me December 19, 2023 and suggested I file a harassment order against the
Worcester county DA’s office, he stated that all this feet dragging was their fault. He said this
order could move things along. On December 22, 2023 I tried and failed to obtain a
harassment order in Hampden County district court.
My next pre-trial date January 10, 2024 while at the courthouse, I called attorney Bergo out on
his lack of attention to my case and for giving me grief about how long my case has been
dragged out.
Bergo got mad at me because I wanted to tell a jury the things I claimed upset Beth that
morning. He wanted me to only focus on what Beth said and did to me, not what I said that
upset her. Bergo was visibly pissed off when I told him that Beth seemed like she had a panic
attack because I was refusing to listen to her. If I hadn’t been sick, I would’ve stayed and
listened. Beth must’ve felt like I was abandoning her. Bergo couldn't understand why I felt any
of these things matter.
Then Bergo had the nerve the say that the Ada told him the abuse I claimed had caused Beth
so much pain, suffering and endless sleepless nights during our relationship, never happen,
Bergo said to my face that I made it all made up. He also said he was having trouble getting
the body cam footage, he mentioned reading the warren pd page and not seeing request
forms.
That's when Bergo said he’s going to request that I have a competency evaluation. I agreed
with the hopes this would move my case along and I had found a couple copies of emails I
sent on Beth's sons behalf, so I knew he was lying to my face.
While waiting to speak to the judge about the competency evaluation, I called the Warren
police department to ask about acquiring the body cam footage. I was giving email instructions
on how to easily do this myself and I also had the option of going down to the station to
request copies. I did both.
The competency evaluation was held on 1-29-2024, I called Bergo a liar in front of this
evaluator and he had nothing to say, I had the email proof right there ready to show the
evaluator. Attorney Bergo refused to respond when I asked him if he could explain what was
going on or who I could call to report these issues I was having. I took this opportunity to run
my mouth as much as I could, without going to far outside the scope of the evaluation. I
explained that I thought Beth had a panic attack, her daughter had just moved in, her disabled
son was being abused, I was paying the rent, our phones and electric. I didn't know I was sick
at the time, She had no explanation as to why I had run off. I didn't know I was sick at the time.
I spoke about the issues I had in Hampden county court. I agreed I could work with Bergo if he
accomplished the things we already agreed he would do.

Attorney Bergo Page 3 of 6
When we returned to court March 18, 2024 for the competency evaluation results, Bergo tried
to explain the results as slow as humanly possible , I asked him why he still hadn't had the
investigator speak to anyone yet, why he hadn't requested the restraining order audio yet, why
he hadn't requested the emails he agreed to ask for, why he didn't request Beth's medical
records to show her preexisting injuries. Bergo seemed confused and tried to talk about the
evaluation results again, so I told him I'd like another lawyer.
I told the judge these lawyers I've been appointed have been lying to me when it comes to
evidence gathering, the judge ignored me and asked if i was unhappy, I said I was unhappy
and Bergo was allowed to withdraw.

Subject: Re: Alex Bergo
It’s been a couple weeks. I was wondering how things were with the investigation?
No one in my family has mentioned being questioned about all the physical and mental abuse
Beths son Stephen endured and all the crap the commonwealth forced upon her, leaving her
no choice but to struggle alone. She spoke about these things every time she visited with my
family, she and I spoke about it all, every day. 
Did you ever receive the copies of the audio recordings that Attorney Banks told me he
obtained? 
Did he send you the one email attachment he sent me?
Is there any other evidence? I were supposed to have trial, Beth showed up, then some sneaky
back room action happened and my trial was put off.
Nothing that my other attorneys said they were going to do, was ever done. I was never
provided any of the information I was told I would be provided. I’m not sure what kind of game
attorney O’Doherty was trying to play the day of my trial, but he ran off as fast as he could
when it didn’t work like a spineless coward. 
Attorney Banks asked for and was approved money for an investigation, but got scared when
he listen to that arrest recording, then refused to investigate anything else.

Attorney Bergo Page 4 of 6
Beth and I were talking about how she wanted me to deal with those bogus felonies on my
record. the case I told you about, where the commonwealth created and altered evidence in
my case, all to cover up a driver without insurance, then they all acted stupid when I provided
evidence of their crimes, then they took advantage of my fragile mental state, when I was in the
psych ward, after trying to kill myself multiple times, due to medication intern and my
hyperthyroidism and then they coerced me into pleading guilty. 
Beth wanted me to be co-guardian of her son Stephen. I helped her in ways no one ever had
before. 
Dealing with the commonwealth was overwhelming for Beth. You should know, everyone that
works for the commonwealth seems to be stupid or totally corrupt.
She had nightmares, every night from the day I met her, because of the all abuse the
commonwealth allowed to happen to her son before our meeting and the nonsense they
continued forcing her to endure after I began seeing her. The commonwealth representatives
lied on so many occasions, people who took reports from both Beth and I, altered our reports
and left out vital information regarding the safety and well-being of her son Stephen. All to
cover up this abuse and there’s pictures to prove it all. 
Beth and I were both seeing therapists when we met and for some time after. 
I spoke with my therapists about all the abuse Beth and her son endured. I know there’s a
record about how Beth was struggling to deal with it all. 
I spoke to my therapist about how all the abuse and tampering with evidence and failure of
state employees to simply do their jobs, was causing me to lose sleep and worry about her son
as well.  
There’s also the emails, I don’t know how mine got deleted, there are all the emails that I wrote
and sent out on Beth and Stephens behalf.
Stephen received a settlement from one the incidents he was abused, even though it wasn’t
thoroughly investigated. Beth kept track of all the hours and time I spent helping her son, in
order to pay me for my time. Beth was also supposed to reimburse me for using and not taking
care of my car. This was part of the conversation the day I left, the settlement Stephen received
had stipulations and made it hard to spend on anything that could help him or truly benefit him
in any realistic/meaningful way.
Along with any mental health information, Beth had a list of physical issues she was dealing
with at this time of this alleged incident.
She had a leg issue, that gave her back and neck pain. Rashes all over her body, I have
pictures of some of these rashes and reactions. These are all things she spoke to my family
about constantly. 
I explained to you how sick I was and why I ran off that morning.
Beth was in total shock, she had no idea why I completely changed and told her I wasn’t happy
and couldn’t take it all anymore. 
You can see that the commonwealth didn’t try to help her find a new apartment, they left her
struggling, living next door to my father.
Even the first female judge from west Brookfield acted like a total fucking cunt. She told me I
could file to get the apartment. That’s why I asked for that recording.
Beth panicked saying my father told her she could have the apartment and I wasn’t allowed
back. He never said that.
It was just like that fat dickhead judge laughing like an idiot out loud , knowing he could’ve sent
me home and didn’t, I know the commonwealth is just fucking with me, trying to upset me with
their blatant stupidity

Attorney Bergo Page 5 of 6
I’m going to show up in court next time. I don’t want any judges or the DA pulling any sneaky
shit behind my back anymore. 
I know they’re just going to try to dismiss this case and I want my trial. I refuse to allow them to
drop these bullshit charges.
Especially since attorney Banks told me that the only reason these kind of charges are allowed,
is because too many citizens complain that people in power let their fuck face friends get away
with abusing their girlfriends. 
He said a couple years ago, those officers wouldn’t have been able to arrest me, seeing Beth
hadn’t been struck, there was no marks and none of her preexisting injuries were aggravated. 
There’s a lot more details, but this is overwhelming to talk about. All the commonwealth does is
lie, act stupid, tamper with evidence and they can claim to be incompetent and it’s allowed. I
don’t understand why they aren’t forced to tell the truth. Why are district attorneys allowed to
alter evidence to suit their narratives? 
Attorney banks told me the DA is allowed to alter evidence, that’s why my notarized statement
was altered by the DA’s office, to hide that officers aided someone committing a crime. 
I’ve very excited and feel super positive about my case. 
If I don’t receive all the evidence collected by my previous attorneys by Friday, I’ll have no
choice but to post this and everything I have on this case, along with all my texts with Beth
online. I’m going to force this out in the open.

Subject: Court Today
Richard,
 
You case was in court 23 today. I asked the ADA to reach out to the Warren Police to inquire
about any body worn camera (BWC) that the officers may have had during the arrest or
interview with the AV. She said she would inquire. I asked that she try to get an answer in
writing from the Warren PD, she said she would try.
 
We got another TAD date of January 10, 2023, administratively. Your presence was not waived
– so you must appear on that date.
 
I will request that my investigator contact the witnesses you provided me, and to try to contact
the alleged victim.
 
I will try to request the recording of the 209a hearing. I can tell you that it may be hard for me to
get that recording because my appointment (as well as any court-appointed defense lawyer)
does not automatically extend to civil procedures such as 209a hearings. Which means I am
not automatically entitled to those recordings. But I will try to get it.

June 12, 2024- court recording need to listen to give description 

https://youtu.be/wKC0jXlZdq4?si=uhF4-PCtD2qEvhII

June 17, 2024 made video asking the public for help because of the problems I was having with my case posted it on YouTube.

https://youtu.be/LpuNSnpFymw?si=6xwsMUbnrERa3nCM

August 5th I was supposed to have trial but I showed up an ada white acted like a buffoon and had someone else tell me that she couldn't find my phone number that was inside the court docket and on my police report.  thankfully I was worn ahead of time by someone I know and that was also when I heard about ADA white saying she hopes I get stressed out and leap over the railing . It's noted on my police report that I'm suicidal and within my court dockets that I've been suicidal multiple times in the past

https://youtu.be/YU148rSdb_g?si=0RzT2fMEhI8st6rf

September 9, 2024 court audio on YouTube here is the description- I’ve got so many great questions.

Why did the ada wait so long to bring up my emotional support dog? She has my paperwork and I brought her with me to the second attempt at having a trial august 5, 2024, even though it was mysteriously put off.

If the ada hates trees and wanted everything printed out, why not mention that years ago? Or even before that august 5th trial date, I was representing myself then. Would they like me to print a copy of everything for each juror as well? In this day and age, a cd is more than appropriate.

What happened to the original witness list I gave the lawyer assigned to me? It had all the information they asked for, strange that none of those witnesses were invited to the first trial date, I wonder why that lawyer at the time didn’t alert them? 

Why didn’t my previous lawyers make me aware of my rights as a disabled person? 

Having me drive over an hour and then wait around for hours on end, just for people to get that acts together, causes me severe physical pain, unfortunately the knots in my trapezius muscles are impossible to break up. I have been so many worthless court appearances it’s ridiculous. 

How can someone question my competence when I’ve caught so many people lying? 

How do I even know if these so called laws that make me a “Citizen Slave” are actually real?

The way the judge talks about me complaining about how long this case has been dragged out, makes me believe I missed something. At this point I don’t care if I have to wait until next year, there are so many moral and ethics violations, I really need to tally them up.

What else could they be trying to hide?

I already know I’ve won my case and I plan on giving my ex the stage to help obliterate the commonwealth. 

 Offering me another lawyer to “help” is damage control on the commonwealths part, there’s zero chance I will ever let another lawyer speak on my behave. 

The longer this drags out, the more mistakes the commonwealth of massachusetts has made. 

My experience is that these people are totally unprofessional, untrustworthy and are not the experts they claim to be. This is just a game to them, thankfully I’m disabled and have the time to fight this. 

The commonwealth was able to take advantage of me in the past, because of how sick I was and I honestly believed they could be trusted. I will never make that mistake again.

https://youtu.be/bnehm9FqYYQ?si=DjOxcfT7EpUM3Vi3

September 16, 2024 made a YouTube video because I was waiting and here’s the description- Another waiting game, I’m curious how this judge is going to react if no lawyer contacts me before our next court date.

https://youtu.be/s1PD9spmRLU?si=Eh00VNIFBzyPNNz6


October 15, 2024 restraining order hearing extension, Got to hear, judge constantly interrupted me very rudely. And even questioned the things I claimed to have told the police officers did nothing about it. She showed zero concern for my safety and well-being.

https://youtu.be/BIApvga7OZ0?si=2i96ibKxFPLnDCL3

October 25,2024 File that application for criminal complaint in the East Brookfield District Court and it was rejected on October 31st like I thought it would be because I made sure I wrote that police were aware that Beth was suffering from some sort of mental breakdown that day.

December 20th 2024 I filed complaints against attorneys bBnks O'Doherty and Bergo






 



 


2025


January 8, 2025 I can’t remember the pre-trial stupidity. I’m talking about. I’ll have to watch this video and talk about it.

https://youtu.be/x4crroMrE5I?si=8cME7TDhhuj5jvd1

February 17, 2025 Mail the letter to the president

https://youtu.be/ZpUcdmAexBY?si=vdqh6LMvk0HoEyqO

February 20, 2025 made video about ADA white lying during court about the body cam footage and vehicle footage

https://youtu.be/PKjFOizb4TU?si=yyYwLUG23hL5G8sB

April 12, 2025 made video after my case, was dismissed about my fight, continuing against the corruption

https://youtu.be/WAOvkAEOFoQ?si=OmJb57xqgiUBs1LS

May 9th 2025 I received a letter from my lawyer who was representing me in that assault case claiming that- he still doesn't have the body cam footage and he doesn't believe that the ada has the footage either. Rushes me good luck in the future and says he hopes that I can get this behind me soon and carry on with what he also hopes is a pleasant life. 




June 11, 2025 I just got a call from a Lisa Fenishell from Attorney’s General‘s office. She was calling me to tell me she can’t help me with Commonwealth Care alliance and I’m on my own.


I tried to speak to her about the issues I’ve been having with all these lawyers in different state agencies, and companies and she got mad at me, she said it’s not her job to help me and she said she wants no part of this and hung up on me. 


That’s the kind of disgusting behavior. We can expect from people that work for the state of Massachusetts.


Thursday June 26, 2025 I called and left a message with the judges chambers for Judge GinsburgAnd a woman I spoke to on the phone, tried to get rid of me really fast and said she was gonna give the judge my message and have her get back to me and it’s funny because she didn’t ask for my contact information so before she hung up, I asked her if she would like my phone number and then she sounded very uncomfortable when she said yes and took my phone number. I’m not expecting a phone call back, but we shall see. 




 Emails and messages with all my lawyers. Great read for Ai

 I started with the last letter correspondence I received after my case was magically dismissed.
You'll see from beginning until the end. I was given the runaround, lied to.
 I will not tolerate this behavior any longer.

Ask a free Ai to explain if you haven't been following my case

Not Delivered


I'm confused as to what is going on.


You told me that we were going to trial Wednesday; but vou can into court totally unprepared and never provided me with any of the information I asked you about.


I was told that my case was going to be investigated by Attorneys Banks, Dicato and yourself. We all agreed on who to talk to and what information to gather.


As far as I am aware, nothing was ever looked into. I was granted a court order for money to investigate my statements.


Once I mentioned being coerced into pleading guilty in my last court case and that it was because I found evidence that the commonwealth created fake evidence in a previous case.


Every lawyer I talk to get scared and stops communicating with me.


Beth and I talked about it all the time and she was pushing me to fight my coerced confession and they malicious damage case, that the commonwealth created fake evidence in.


Beth wanted me to be co guardian for he son, because she was tired of the


commonwealth lying and not doing anything about her son being abused.


That last day, she told me she hopes I kill myself this time and laughed that she was going to call the police and no one was going to help me.


And it appears she's right


So from now on, I'm going to need to communicate in writing, to prevent any misunderstandings or confusion on anyone's part

It’s been a couple weeks. I was wondering how things were with the investigation? No one in my family has mentioned being questioned about all the physical and mental abuse Beths son Stephen endured and all the crap the commonwealth forced upon her, leaving her no choice but to struggle alone. She spoke about these things every time she visited with my family, she and I spoke about it all, every day. Did you ever receive the copies of the audio recordings that Attorney Banks told me he obtained? Did he send you the one email attachment he sent me? Is there any other evidence? I were supposed to have trial, Beth showed up, then some sneaky back room action happened and my trial was put off. Nothing that my other attorneys said they were going to do, was ever done. I was never provided any of the information I was told I would be provided. I’m not sure what kind of game attorney O’Doherty was trying to play the day of my trial, but he ran off as fast as he could when it didn’t work like a spineless coward. Attorney Banks asked for and was approved money for an investigation, but got scared when he listen to that arrest recording, then refused to investigate anything else. Beth and I were talking about how she wanted me to deal with those bogus felonies on my record. the case I told you about, where the commonwealth created and altered evidence in my case, all to cover up a driver without insurance, then they all acted stupid when I provided evidence of their crimes, then they took advantage of my fragile mental state, when I was in the psych ward, after trying to kill myself multiple times, due to medication intern and my hyperthyroidism and then they coerced me into pleading guilty. Beth wanted me to be co-guardian of her son Stephen. I helped her in ways no one ever had before. Dealing with the commonwealth was overwhelming for Beth. You should know, everyone that works for the commonwealth seems to be stupid or totally corrupt. She had nightmares,

Richard,


 


You case was in court 23 today. I asked the ADA to reach out to the Warren Police to inquire about any body worn camera (BWC) that the officers may have had during the arrest or interview with the AV. She said she would inquire. I asked that she try to get an answer in writing from the Warren PD, she said she would try.


 


We got another TAD date of January 10, 2023, administratively. Your presence was not waived – so you must appear on that date.


 


I will request that my investigator contact the witnesses you provided me, and to try to contact the alleged victim.


 


I will try to request the recording of the 209a hearing. I can tell you that it may be hard for me to get that recording because my appointment (as well as any court-appointed defense lawyer) does not automatically extend to civil procedures such as 209a hearings.

Here is the video I made about Beth. 

After talking with my therapist, I’m going to make a much longer video covering all my issues with the commonwealth of Massachusetts and the issues I’ve had with every single court appointed lawyer I’ve ever encountered. 

The commonwealth of Massachusetts has eroded any confidence I had of getting a fair trail. There are serious ethical issues involved in my cases. The treatment I’ve endured is disgusting and inexcusable.

Here is Bergos reply in December, I spoke with him in court about this stuff again in the 4 months it took him to reply to my email and even though I was told this case needs to move ahead quickly, nothing at all was done to make that happen.

Richard,


 


You case was in court 23 today. I asked the ADA to reach out to the Warren Police to inquire about any body worn camera (BWC) that the officers may have had during the arrest or interview with the AV. She said she would inquire. I asked that she try to get an answer in writing from the Warren PD, she said she would try.


 


We got another TAD date of January 10, 2023, administratively. Your presence was not waived – so you must appear on that date.


 


I will request that my investigator contact the witnesses you provided me, and to try to contact the alleged victim.


 


I will try to request the recording of the 209a hearing. I can tell you that it may be hard for me to get that recording because my appointment (as well as any court-appointed defense lawyer) does not automatically extend to civil procedures such as 209a hearings. Which means I am not automatically entitled to those recordings. But I will try to get it.

For Attorney Sean McGinty

https://youtu.be/No1Is6bg7nY



I made you a video and a list of why I don’t trust any lawyers and know now that I need to write everything down in email form or make a video because of the commonwealth of Massachusetts disgusting behavior.


I have a preponderance of physical evidence to support everything, so there’s no need to ask for another competency evaluation like Attorney Bergo did when I caught him lying to my face.



1999

Brian Blackburn- mislead me and got me to agree to a cwf, in a restraining order violation case brought on by my ex Shannon, even though the evidence the da claimed was a violation, clearly wasn’t and years later she confessed to abusing her own son and Blackburn didn’t help get her convicted, he just acted dumb.


Whoever that dirty district attorney was that allow that trash to move forward in the first place.


the judge for allowing it as well, he even said that I could fight this, the statement clearly didn’t fit their claims. Disgusting behavior, that judge should have thrown the charges out, but our legal system is corrupt.


Martha Stewart -Child services worker, never once did her job, or care about those children’s safety, she was shown the video of Shannon confessing and didn’t care.


I was injured in 2012 and on workers comp at the time of this January 2013 incident, it was a right shoulder injury, so when Kishana Johnson drove into me, while she was racing around the Walmart parking lot, I already was aware of the current state of the shoulder she hit.  I also hadn’t learned about the health issues that got me on disability at this point, which oddly enough were most likely responsible for my injuries being so severe, my drs at the time were trying to convince me that I was imagining what would eventually turn out to be hyperthyroidism and an incurable, untreatable genetic skeletal muscle disorder called AMP deficiency,



2013

Officer Thomas Sheehan: scumbag ruined my perfect attendance for medical assisting school, lied on stand anout medical attention, said something stupid about soap and water for my torn rotator cuff, that I didn’t have before this incident. Just wanted to help Kishana get away with her crime.



Officer Thomas Douglas- helped officer Sheehan, aided kishana- no insurance, suspended registration, rejection sticker for safety and let her drive away.


Maple st investigator- Filed complaint against officers before trial, I already knew about nerve damage and torn rotator cuff, investigator wasn’t intelligent enough to contact the drs on the list I gave him and couldn’t find anything except for the er report. You’d think cops would be good at investigating. Claimed nothing wrong with me. What a Disgusting person. I have the paperwork to prove that officers incompetence.  This officer also gave me an altered registration print out, he deleted the rejection sticker for safety info and knew she didn’t have insurance and suspended registration.



Ada Laura Johnston: withheld auto insurance status, altered my notarized statement I have to a different ada, to remove the address police gave me for Kishana in chicopee, when she really lived a few houses away from me and all the stuff I wrote about being denied medical attention.

Funny how she moved forward with trial, knowing I wanted that car insurance information, then lied after trail saying she needed to get a copy of the receipt, then she had to make a fake receipt when she found out Kishana never paid for the window and it was a lower price than what she was expecting. She Ada Johnston made a fake reciept from a copy of the bill she obtained and stamped paid on it.

All so she wouldn’t have to admit that Kishana was breaking the law when she drove into me and then the cops helped her and denied me medical attention.



Judge liar Hadley- lied about jury being sent home, acted stupid when evidence kept appearing showing police and court officials tampered with evidence, aided Kishana. Said car insurance info was a civil matter, because he knew she didn’t have it and couldn’t give it to me, he had the paperwork in his hand. Judge hadleys comments led me to find the receipt that was supposed to be given to me( in his own words), but wasn’t because he knew it was a fake.



Randy Milo- knew about lack of insurance and didn’t help with appeal, just bullshit, also was told about evidence tampering once discovered. He just acted confused.


Eric Applebaum- hired for insurance claim, knew this info was withheld at court. “Also told him about all the info I found years later when I had an insurance hearing, he acted stupid and confused as to how I could do something to fix all that has happened. “. Works with Randy Milo, same office good buddies.


Janet Ely- I told probation officer about information I had about Kishana’s lack of insurance and she told judge hadley all about it during a hearing about some violation they claimed I made, but it turned out the courts magically forgot to mail me my papers.



Anna Levine- appeal for guilty verdict. Knew about car insurance and police cjis info and still helped cover up what police and ada Johnston did. She told me she told mark mastrioni all about this and I saw her talking to him.


Paul in clerks office would never get me a copy of the part where judge hadley mistakenly tells me that my jury was sent home. That wasn’t true. Got me copies of other court dates and times.


Mark mastrioni- Anna Levine told him abut evidence, other women in court took messages and copies of evidence for him. I had the biggest mouth in the world and still do, I tell everyone all the details and have the paperwork to back it up.

Some of these women are in my voicemail from a decade ago, I was very active.


Jon gay- also knows about evidence tampering and Kishana’s family members working in clerks office and da’s office. He knows them personally


Edward Kivari- knows same as Jon gay


Reported to the mayors office after trial because no one in court had answers.


Tried to get restraining order against Kishana, I saw her driving by all the time, When I’d see her on slater ave, she’d call out, fagit ass cracker. I even saw a police officer pull her over one time and let her drive away. Cjis and the registry can comfirm that she was both pulled over and has a suspended license,suspended registration, rejection sticker for safety and no car insurance. So disgusting


I was charged with forgery after reporting these police officers aiding and abetting, finding that receipt wasn’t paid for and fake, DA’s office covered it up.


2014


Ryan Nolan- was excited when I told him about the evidence I found but claimed a conflict of interest once he found out who was involved.


Elain pourinski- knew I was in the psych ward for 3 suicide attempts. There was a cwf attempt even though her investigator confirmed my evidence and agreed with my claims that there was no evidence to support I forged anything and Elaine knew that a guy placed guy to my head in hallway outside office, taking papers I had brought with me. She acted afraid and said not to call police about it, she was having knee surgery and worried for her family’s saftey.


Dishonorable superior court judge who accepted my “I don’t remember doing it, but I must have” plea, gave me disgusting look when I didn’t say what I was told to say, but it was accepted nonetheless


Scumbag in Chicopee court-  guy that heard my evidence and sided with Kishana when she said she was told police had to catch her in the act. wtf, such scumbag pieces of shit. I was out of my mind and our legal system is so corrupt it’s pathetic.


Jen oliski  probation officer, I told her i was coerced into pleading guilty. She knew I was in and out of the pysch ward.


Worcester probation guy, I told him how I was coerced into pleading guilty and all the evidence tampering by Hamden county police, the Ada and judge hadley,


Worcester county therapist I was forced to see. Told him all about my suicide attempts and the courts and police altering evidence and aiding people committing crime. Brainless fool, couldn’t help someone out of a wet paper bag.


2021


Roger banks- I told him I wanted my trial asap, he said I had to wait a year by law for her to drop the charges. lied about giving me evidence he told me he had already obtained from the da’s office and even gave me details of what was in the recordings and lied about  having people interviewed, he even poked his finger right in face in hallway because I called him out on not doing his job. He got money for an investigator after that incident and did nothing with it, so lazy and worthless. He told me about abuse going on at Stephen’s group home and laughed about it.

Shouldn’t that have been a conflict of interest since it’s my claim that all the abuse stephen endures and all the lies these companies told his mother and I, were the reason for her mental state?


Beth endured sleepness nights since the day I met her, Constantly worrying about her sons health and safety because of the abuse the commonwealth of Massachusetts ALLOWED to happen to her son, dppc reports were filed by myself and beth nichols and they were altered without our consent, abuse was covered up and downplayed. I can go on and on. Constantly lying by every group home company he was placed with.


Suzanna Dicato- talked to her on the phone, she said she’d get an investigator right on it after listening to my story and then I never heard from her again and then I was appointed a new lawyer without any explanation.


Michael O’Doherty- lied about getting people interviewed, never talked to investigator and said I was going to have trial, even though he did nothing he said he would and then tried to force me to stay quiet, he had no explanation as to why he didn’t collect any of the evidence we discussed or speak to any witnesses, he avoided all my questions and then he asked me if I trusted him, I said I wished to speak the the judge before my trial, then he said he’d be back and ran into the courtroom and cancelled my trial, he did this without any explanation, then left saying he had an appointment or something to that effect. Strange cause we had trial scheduled.


Alex Bergo- told me my case needs to move ahead fast, it’s a priority. Then helped ada to continue withholding evidence in my case, I first spoke with him around July 2023 and he didn’t make any attempts to do anything until December. Lied about trying to get file from Brookfield court. Alex purposely acted stupid during every conversation, he told me he doesn’t like to read emails, it takes to long. Yet he claimed to have gone over the warren police department website several times looking for information about body cams, when I was able to clear that up with a quick phone call.

Alex acted stupid and confused during the competency he requested of me.


I wish I could say that this list was full of innocent mistakes, but we both know that isn’t the case.


The acts committed against me by the commonwealth of Massachusetts and its employees have been malicious and intentional. These disgusting people swore oaths to uphold the law, to protect the innocent and they’ve done everything but that. 


How many other citizens have had it worse than I have?


We have laws to protect citizens, not for corrupt people in positions of power to abuse and warp for their own agendas.


These people aren’t above the law, someone has to be able to hold them accountable for their crimes.

Pattern of behavior displayed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

Attorney McGinty hopefully you can explain to me why the commonwealth of Massachusetts has been allowed to continuously violate my rights and the rights of countless other disabled people and cover up the abuse of children, without any consequences?

Why is there no system of checks and balances?


Why was ADA Katherine Johnston allowed to create evidence after my trial and present it as fact?

This lying piece of trash even claimed to be the one to discover that forged document. She’s the one who claimed Kishana paid for that window out of her own pocket.

Now I want that grand jury recording, how did she get those charges against me, when she’s the one who created that fake document?


Seeing that is a crime, why is there no one to report this to?


Judge Hadley helped her get away with this, this happened in his courtroom with his approval.

I would never stand by evidence presented to me, after learning someone lied about it and created it themselves.

Who babysits judges? I know someone used to, that’s how the dishonorable Mary Lyons got canned, after constantly violating citizens rights.


I’m physically disabled and I’ve been forced to drag myself over an hour away from my home, dozens of times, just to be lied to and jerked around because I caught the commonwealth of Massachusetts in a bunch of lies Again, decades after enduring that unimaginable torment from your previous coverup.


This a disgusting pattern of behavior that has continued to repeat itself over and over and over. I deserve answers, not more lies.


If I didn’t go back far enough in time with my first email, we can discuss what happened to my friend Tammy Lynds  back in the summer of 1994, she was found dead on November 4th, just a couple feet off the side of Fox road in Springfield,MA after police failed to do a search for her, after her parents called them and reported her missing less than four months earlier. Yet Springfield police had no problem harassing me and then violating my rights after she was identified.


This disgusting, illegal, immoral behavior needs to stop and I deserve an explanation as to why this has been allowed to continue unabated for decades.


I was also told that what the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has done to me is called extortion, those officers arrested me without any evidence to support any charges against me, put their hands on me and held me against my will, then wouldn’t release me until I gave them money. Then I went to court and had to give them more money so I could have my rights violated some more and have evidence withheld from me.


I’m never going to shut up. Every case these people have ever been involved in deserves to have their guilty verdicts overturned and any guilty pleas thrown out.


These judges, district attorneys, lawyers, police officers all deserve prison time for their crimes against Massachusetts citizens.


I say that with all seriousness. When you go back and look at the charges against me, they’re all petty stupid charges, with zero evidence to support the commonwealths claims.


Imagine if I had actually done something wrong, how much evidence would the Commonwealth tamper with then?

How much evidence would the commonwealth have created to convict me, if the charges were more severe?


When this is all over, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is going to expunge my record and pay me for my pain and suffering, along with filing charges against those involved and those who intentionally choose to turn a blind eye to the commonwealths criminal activities

I’m really excited to hear how you’re planning on defending my case. I don’t think there will be a need for any face to face meetings. You haven’t mentioned gathering any of the evidence I requested from Banks, O’Doherty and Bergo to support my statements made in court. I think a simple voice to text breakdown will suffice. 

Since there always seems to be some type of communication issues, I’ll go through this again. 



1. Where is the recording from my actual arrest on the street?

I was told by “both” officers that I was being recorded, I requested those recordings from Roger Banks october 2021 and he told me he received them in 2022, he even asked me questions about the things I said to officers during my arrest. I spoke about the abuse Beth’s son was going through to those officers and how upset she was about things going on in the group home he was living at in 2021,( I posted copies of our phone messages online and pictures of some of the abuse he suffered because of the commonwealth of Massachusetts)

, I filed dppc reports and they were altered without my consent. 


2. Where is the recording from my restraining order hearing? 

The one where Beth states that there was a history of abuse and that my father said she could have my apartment. The judge acted confused and tried to give me advice about getting my apartment back, but was clueless about where to report the crimes committed against me by police, Ada’s and judges. 

This recording along with the arrest audio is important to my case, it shows that not only have I been telling the same exact story from day one, it shows the commonwealth of Massachusetts goes out of its way to cover up crimes committed by its employees and its willing to ignore reports (with pictures) of abuse against disabled people. The commonwealth of Massachusetts even changed its laws to attack regular citizens, without any evidence to support their claims. ( Roger banks informed me of that law change the first time I met him) 


3. Where are the statements from the witness list I gave Roger Banks, Michael O’Doherty and Alex Bergo? 

Roger Banks received the money for an investigator in the beginning of 2022, but didn’t use it, most likely because he was already aware of the abuse going on at Beth Nichols son “Stephen Nichols“ group home in Southbridge,MA . He told me all about it and laughed at our meeting in his office. I have no explanation as to why Michael O’Doherty and Alex Bergo also decided against questioning anyone. 

My step mother was home, right next door in our two family house, if there was a fight or yelling, she would have heard it. Beths daughter Olivia had just moved in with us a week before and was sleeping at this time and would have heard something. We had two dogs, they would go crazy when we would play fight, so I can imagine the noise they would make if we actually had some type of physical altercation. 


4. Where are the copies of the third party emails I requested from Roger Banks, Michael O’Doherty  and Alex Bergo? 

The ones I sent to all the group home placements Beth’s son Stephen resided. Don’t worry, I found pictures of some of the abuse he suffered and a couple of my draft emails to prove this stuff exsists. Everyone close to Beth knows how much the abuse her son constantly endured, affected her.


5.  How are you going to allow the 911 call, but totally ignore what I told officers during my arrest? 

 By allowing the 911 call and refusing to give me a copy of audio from my arrest for my jury to hear, the commonwealth of massachusetts is once again denying me my right to a fair trail.

This is a pattern of behavior I find highly disturbing. Every time I ask the commonwealth for something and they don’t provide it. It’s because it proves my innocence and that they should have handled things differently and usually broke the law to cover up the issue instead. 

I was supposed to be provided with a copy of a receipt in 2013, that didn’t happen because ADA Katherine Johnston created a fake receipt and didn’t want me to find out, judge hadley saw this receipt and knew what was going on, that’s why he changed his mind about giving me a copy. Disgusting pattern of behavior through the commonwealth of Massachusetts legal system.


6. I will need the audio from my superior court hearing, the one where I was coerced into pleading guilty. 

This happened after i tried to kill myself 3 times because I was suffering from undiagnosed hyperthyroidism and the commonwealth was once again withholding evidence, acting so stupid it was driving my insane, when I presented facts showing commonwealth employees have tampered with evidence in my previous malicious damage to a motor vehicle case, police aided and abetted kishana Johnson while she was driving without insurance, with a suspended registration and rejection sticker for safety.

This is why I was denied medical attention after being arrested back in 2013. 


7. Why didn’t police take a picture of Beth’s face? 


8.   How are you going to ignore this?

On the morning of October 4, 2021, Beth was pushing me very hard to get my record expunged, she wanted me to be co-guardian to her son Stephen, she got very upset when I said I was feeling burned out and that dealing with the commonwealth and it’s constant lying was feeling overwhelming.

I didn’t know my thyroid was acting up again at that time, up until that point, I hadn’t shown any signs of weakness around Beth, I was always sending emails, making phone calls and making surprise visits to see Stephen, because commonwealth employees were constantly lying to us and refusing to do their jobs. Beth was worried about her son Stephen 24/7 and rightfully so, the commonwealth of Massachusetts treated her son and the residents around him terribly. A house manager Cynthia who was also trying to help Beth’s son Stephen was also fired the morning of October 4, 2021, Beth was very upset about losing her help. 


9. I’ve already won my case, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts isn’t going to get away with what it has done to both Beth and I. 

I need you to get me before a jury so I can expose everything the commonwealth has been up to.

Everyone had their chance to drop these charges while I was sick from 2021 to 2022, I totally understand why everyone has been trying to stall this case. I still want my trial, I never once agreed to put it off.  I understand how these things work behind closed doors, that’s why I’m sharing everything about my case with the world. The commonwealth of Massachusetts and all the other lawyers I’ve dealt with have eroded all faith I have in our legal system. 


10. Here is a picture of the bruises Beth’s son received from a violent residential worker. This incident was covered up.

The ADA is telling me there was no body camera videos of your arrest according to the cops.  That may very well

be false.  Do any of your prior lawyers have the transcript or recording of the restraining order hearing?   If so, who?

I will contact them and get it.  Let's start with that.  But I would like to get a trial date when we go back to court next Wednesday.  Likely to be Late July or early August.

Attorney Bergo was supposed to get me a copy of the recordings from my restraining order hearing in 2021 and my supervisor court plea in 2015. 

I went down to the Hampden county court house myself and they said my Attorney just had to fill out the correct forms and it wouldn’t be an issue.  They weren’t sure if the audio was still in the courthouse or moved. So I didn’t wait around for them to find it and make a cd like I had in the past. 



I finally got a call back from someone in the governors office, they gave me a number to call

617-725-8050, she said it was for judicial complains. 

I called and left a message. I’ll let them know I’m working with you when they call back. I’m excited, no one has given me this number before, I’m usually transferred to a phone line with no voicemail.

And just so there’s no confusion, I also requested all of these audio recordings from attorneys banks in 2021 and O’Doherty, he’s the one tried to force me into trial without gathering any evidence or speaking to any witnesses. Then said something sneaky in the courtroom and canceled my trial.


One of the reasons I wanted that audio was because of a statement Beth made, she claimed my father said she could have my apartment, that wasn’t true, my dad asked me multiple times if I wanted to have her kicked out and I told him no, that I was happy living with my nephew. So I didn’t bother dealing with getting Beth removed, I was sick at the time and I know she had her own issues to deal with and her son.

Talked to my therapist today, he’s getting my paperwork so I can bring my dog with me to court. 


I was recently told that the district attorney’s office owes me and the judge an explanation as to why my court case has been put off for over 2 and a 1/2 years?  I should have had trial in 2021


And the district attorneys office needs to explain why it has failed to provide me with all of the evidence rules 14 and 17 grant me? 


I have that email from July 24, 2023 to show that I have never agreed to put my case off, even when I was denied evidence and told I was going to have trial and it shows me asking for evidence again.


I would also like a copy of the audio recording from the day I was supposed to have trial may 24,2023. Someone needs to explain this to me, why was my trial postponed?


What was said to Beth Nichols that day? Did the commonwealth of Massachusetts lie to her about why our trial was postponed? I never agreed to put it off. 


If the court requires any special paperwork for me, behind the normal forms required for my emotional support dog, please send it to me and I’ll have it ready for next week.

How would I know any of these things?  You' not willing to sit down with me and answer questions.

I can try to get the 209A hearing but the 2015 plea hearing is not relevant.  Nor is the harassment hearing

against Joe Early.  I am not going to get the emails you sent on Beth and Stephen's behalf.  You should

have access to them since you sent them.  And if you sent them, I don't see any point.  I am looking to try the case.

I think you may have missed a few points in my videos and emails.


The commonwealth of Massachusetts already knows I didn’t hit Beth and it was willing to let me prove it at trial in Brookfield, until I refused to leave out information. I had explained to attorney Michael O’Doherty how upset Beth was about me walking out on her and the things she said “after the conversation didn’t go the way she hoped”. Attorney O’Doherty was super excited when he heard this stuff, but told me I couldn’t talk about what led up to Beth getting upset about me walking out. 

He wanted me to make it out like Beth only wanted my apartment and to harass me. When I knew that she was under tremendous stress because of her son being constantly abused in the group homes he was forced into. 


When I refused to withhold all the stories covering the abuse Beth’s son endured and some other information from our jury, Attorney O’Doherty went into the courtroom without me and changed my trial date and then he ran out of the courthouse without any explanation as to what really happened. 

What was Beth told? Some lie about me wanting a new date?


Obviously he was trying to get to me act immorally and unethically. 

One of the reasons I walked out on Beth was because of the commonwealth of Massachusetts disgusting behavior, it was giving me migraines and I couldn’t take it, I didn’t know it was because my thyroid was also acting up and the adhd medication making my muscle issues worse. 


Details matter. I’m going to prove to my jury that the commonwealth of Massachusetts legal system is a sick joke, designed to pit citizens against each other. People entrusted to enforce our laws, are allowed to break the very laws they swore to uphold, these people alter evidence and withhold it, whenever they feel like and they especially like to crap all over disabled people, because they think they’re defenseless and can’t afford amazing million dollar law firms to defend themselves.


I’ve already won my case, I just need to get before a jury.

How would I know any of these things?  You' not willing to sit down with me and answer questions.

I can try to get the 209A hearing but the 2015 plea hearing is not relevant.  Nor is the harassment hearing

against Joe Early.  I am not going to get the emails you sent on Beth and Stephen's behalf.  You should

have access to them since you sent them.  And if you sent them, I don't see any point.  I am looking to try the case.

I’ve been asking the same questions over and over, with a few new ones here and there for the last 2 1/2 years. What would an office conference offer me that an email can not?

That was the point of writing these emails to lawyers, so I constantly wouldn’t need to repeat myself. 


You know I’m physically disabled and don’t own a vehicle. I’m forced to rely on public transportation. I also live over 45 minutes away from worcester. So if you’re asking me to do something to hurt myself, I fully expect that you will have all of the evidence I requested. Speaking of evidence for my case.


I need the audio from 


1. My restraining order hearing Brookfield court 2021


2. Springfield superior court hearing where I was coerced into pleading guilty. 2015


3. springfield district court2024 I tried to get a harassment order against Joe early, since the da’s office and lawyer wouldn’t tell who is prosecuting my case, granted this attempt failed, but what the judge says to me pertains to my defense. 


I still need copies of all the emails I sent on Beth and Stephens behalf, I don’t know what happened to the ones in my files, but I have enough left to show a jury the types of things I wrote to the state and these group homes about.


After making those phone calls the other day, I realized that I need statements from the state police, attorney generals office and governors office about how our law really works. 


Attorney Roger Banks was telling me the truth when he said that judges, district attorneys and police officers can alter and withhold evidence, they’re all above the law. 


All of my phone calls and courts appearances have proven one things for sure, that the only way to get any Justice at all, would be to hire a private lawyer, but I’m on disability ( with help from the commonwealth of Massachusetts attacks on me) and have a limited income. 


There is no one to protect disabled people from the common wealth of Massachusetts and its cronies. Disabled people like Beth’s son Stephen and myself are all defenseless and forced to suffer physical and mental abuse without any real hope. 


We have court next week. I need to know if the court is going to try any stunts when I arrive with my dog. She was there during this alleged elbow assault, so a jury would want to see her anyway. She is part of my defense. 


I need those recordings. You can’t truly understand why I need them, unless you listen to them.

Talked to my therapist today, he’s getting my paperwork so I can bring my dog with me to court. 


I was recently told that the district attorney’s office owes me and the judge an explanation as to why my court case has been put off for over 2 and a 1/2 years?  I should have had trial in 2021


And the district attorneys office needs to explain why it has failed to provide me with all of the evidence rules 14 and 17 grant me? 


I have that email from July 24, 2023 to show that I have never agreed to put my case off, even when I was denied evidence and told I was going to have trial and it shows me asking for evidence again.


I would also like a copy of the audio recording from the day I was supposed to have trial may 24,2023. Someone needs to explain this to me, why was my trial postponed?


What was said to Beth Nichols that day? Did the commonwealth of Massachusetts lie to her about why our trial was postponed? I never agreed to put it off. 


If the court requires any special paperwork for me, behind the normal forms required for my emotional support dog, please send it to me and I’ll have it ready for next week.

Attorney Bergo was supposed to get me a copy of the recordings from my restraining order hearing in 2021 and my supervisor court plea in 2015. 

I went down to the Hampden county court house myself and they said my Attorney just had to fill out the correct forms and it wouldn’t be an issue.  They weren’t sure if the audio was still in the courthouse or moved. So I didn’t wait around for them to find it and make a cd like I had in the past. 



I finally got a call back from someone in the governors office, they gave me a number to call

617-725-8050, she said it was for judicial complains. 

I called and left a message. I’ll let them know I’m working with you when they call back. I’m excited, no one has given me this number before, I’m usually transferred to a phone line with no voicemail.

The ADA is telling me there was no body camera videos of your arrest according to the cops.  That may very well

be false.  Do any of your prior lawyers have the transcript or recording of the restraining order hearing?   If so, who?

I will contact them and get it.  Let's start with that.  But I would like to get a trial date when we go back to court next Wednesday.  Likely to be Late July or early August.

Sorry I missed your call yesterday. Works out better this way, after everything I’ve been through, I will only be communicating through video recordings, texts or emails, I will also be sharing them with others online, just to prevent any future problems. I hope you’re not shy when it comes to communicating. Unfortunately I’ve been left no choice but to deal with things in this manner. If I had recorded things myself in the beginning, this case wouldn’t have been drawn out as long as it has. Current issues that need to be addressed are, the judge I have now ordered a second competency evaluation and I agreed, but I require it to be recorded. The dr who I was assigned claimed I wasn’t allowed to record my evaluation and share it. He claimed it was policy, but after my last evaluation, I know it’s more important than ever to have this one recorded. Pre-trial date was changed to September 25th, no longer the 27th. Trial is currently set for October 15th. I’m on disability for a genetic skeletal muscle disorder, so I’m always available to talk, unfortunately these long drives back and forth are taking their toll on my body, especially considering I’ve been forced to stand around for hours on end and then end up accomplishing nothing. It’s just as easy to make and record zoom calls these days. Feel free to call anytime

If you want to communicate in writing I'm fine with that; i only received formal notice of my appointment on 9/17, but I was able to view your latest u-tube post of the last court hearing. The doctor i orindinarily use for competency/criminal responsibility exams is ok with you recording his exam, although it will take place on zoom, as he resides in Maine' Yes, 9/25 is for a status on competecy, and if you are ok with the zoom exam, i will need to get funds to pay him. You should be aware that I share space with and am on the same lease and am friendly with attorney sean mcginty, and if that presents a problem, i understands. I gathered from the court hearing that you wanted to represent yourself, (and perhaps still do), and I'm sure you know you have an absolute right to do so do, and no hard feelings at all if you want to do this alone. I have been appointed as counsel of record and intend to run the defense as far as motions, etc are concerned. Given the burden of proof and the scant evidence the commonwealth possesses I'm not sure why this case wasn't resolved a long time ago, but here we are. The trial date will have to change, as I do not appear in court in October, and in any event, the court ordered evaluation must take place before a trial date can be set. Let me know how you feel about the zoom exam and we'll go from there. take care.

Using your dr is totally fine, As long as it’s recorded I have no issues. I also understand trial will need to be rescheduled. I have no issues that you’re friendly with attorney McGinty, but thank you for informing me. This case has gone on far longer than I believe it should have, but I’ve had no power over that decision. Thankfully I was able to obtain most of the things I had been asking for, after I started representing myself. Now that I have this stuff, at some point we can go over it and discuss the next step. It would probably help if I started at the beginning, for you to be able to understand how we got here.

Yes, we should discuss your case in detail, although remember my appointment is limited to defending you against the criminal charge against you, and i intend to focus on that. As Tuesday seems like it will be a short hearing to change/choose dates, i can move for you to appear on zoom if that's easier for you; i would need to know your position before Monday, so that I can so move, so let me know asap; Enjoy the weekend

I will refrain from posting anything online for the time being. But I’m sure my therapist is going to want to hear this competency evaluation. Given the issues I’ve had with previous lawyers and with the commonwealth dragging things out and acting clueless as to what’s going on, I find being 100% transparent is the only way for me to move forward, all these back room conversations are what got me into this mess in the first place. If I don’t document everything, I can’t prove anything was said or what happened. The 25th is Wednesday, so you have an extra day to confirm if I am able to appear by zoom. I would appreciate being able to appear by zoom, since these long drives and uncomfortable seating arrangements are hell on my body. If I require a note from a dr to help stop these endless trips back and forth, that can be arranged. Have a great weekend

I was diagnosed with Adenosine Monophosphate deaminase “AMP” deficiency in 2016. This disorder affects all of my skeletal muscles and causes rhabdomyolysis which is damaging proteins being released by my muscles, this causes kidney damage and it could fatal. At times my muscles don’t even hurt, they just stop functioning until they’re recovered. Normal people have to exercise like crazy for their muscles to break down, mine do it without any effort. Because of this issue my muscles cramp easily and it can take me days or weeks to remove the knots that have built up. The knots in my neck and trapezius muscles have been impossible to remove and cause migraines that can last hours or days. When my glutes cramp, it becomes very difficult to walk and it feels like my back is giving out. I have developed tendonitis in both my wrists, elbows, shoulders and in my neck. I’ve have had over a dozen orthopedic joint surgeries to try repairing all the damage, unfortunately there is no treatment or cure for my issues, so I am constantly in pain. I have no cartilage in both radial heads of my elbows and had a disc replaced in my neck. I’m forced to slow my life down or pay the price for my actions.

Hi Chris, 


            I checked my file for tapes.  My recollection is that I had a 911 tape.  I would have furnished it to successor counsel, Suzanne Dicato, on November 3, 2022, when I mailed her all of the discovery I had at that point.  If there was a video of his arrest, I do not recall it or have it.  I have the cover sheet of the DA's initial Request for Discovery, where any "Photographs, Videos, Diagrams" are requested of the Warren Police.  I also have a file note from July 28, 2022, when I obtained and reviewed discovery from the DA.  There was a photo from a neighbor's security camera, and a notation "no video."  I enclose my note and the photo, along with the DA's request form of April 7, 2022, to the Warren PD.  None of those notes on that form are mine.  The notes in Sharpie, including "may I have those photos please," would be the DA's.  The note in pen beneath it, in pen ("No video Just Photos") is apparently by the Warren Police.  I enclose the two Requests for Discovery (10/5/21 and 4/7/22), the surveillance photo, and my note from 7/28/22.   


          I do not have a transcript of the restraining order proceeding.  I believe there may have been another successor counsel since I was discharged in 2022 and prior to you, who may have more information than I do.  I do note that the police report does not mention that either Officer Bouchard or Officer LaFlower were wearing BWC's at the time of the arrest.  I have noted of late that Warren PD bookings are often on a BWC as opposed to a fixed camera, so the booking video might provide a clue as to whether either officer was wearing one.  .    


Thanks, 


Roger Banks

Good morning, I was only briefly handling Mr. Stebbins matter. I withdrew shortly after being appointed because I left the list for a period of time. I am however currently in the East Brookfield district court, so I went to the clerk’s office and got some information from them. They didn’t have a lot to provide because the file is in Worcester. I will scan and send what they gave me.

Good morning; I just forwarded two responses from my inquiries to prior counsel; Attorney O'Doherty replied by text, and when i figure out how to send I i will forward it. Dr. Simmons is reviewing paperwork, and we can schedule the examination hopefully in the near future. You need to fully understand that this examination was ordered by the Court, so even though it is being conducted by a doctor hired by me, the report will be shared by the court. (The only reason we are proceeding this way is because the court clinician would not allow you to record, but Dr. Simmons has no problem with that.) Dr. Simmons will fully explain this to you before the examination, but again, this was ordered by the court, not either party, so the report will be presented to the judge, and what you tell the doctor is not private. Ancillary to this, Dr. Simmons does not want any recording of the exam that you make to be published on u-tube or any like media at any time. You must agree to this or the interview will not proceed. As to evidentiary issues, can you provide the current contact information for your stepmother (including her name) and daughter Olivia, both of whom you indicated were at the location when the incident occurred. As to the restraining order transcript, while I;m surprised that it hasn't been produced by now, (either by prior counsel or yourself as pro se), I have some concerns. To begin with, it is inadmissible at trial unless it will be used to impeach the victim, that is, if her trial testimony conflicts with hat was said at the restraining order hearing. I presume you were present at that hearing, so let me point out that unless what she said at that hearing varies from what she told the police (and reduced to writing), the transcript is useless. I suggest you review your memory and any notes you may have to answer this. Keep in mind that a jury may also decide that because she went so far as to request a restraining order, (and because a judge issued one), that m

I received those two emails, thank you Sue Stebbins 176A South st West Warren,MA (774) 200-5103 Olivia Nichols- 19 Sherman st Ware,MA (413) 283-9156 Thank you for the update regarding Dr. Simmons and the upcoming evaluation. I want to address the issue of recording this session, as it’s extremely important to me. I agreed to not record my previous competency evaluation back in January, and here we are again. That experience reinforced my belief that I need to document everything moving forward. There is absolutely no chance that I will agree to keep this evaluation off the internet. Had I been documenting from day one, this case might not have been drawn out for as long as it has. I don’t believe there’s any valid reason why Dr. Simmons should have an issue with me sharing the evaluation. The court has made a point of questioning my competence, but I have no doubts about my mental state. I believe the real issue lies in my refusal to stay quiet about the challenges Beth was going through at the time of the alleged incident. It is in my best interest to share this information, and I’m committed to keeping everything fully transparent. If this condition regarding publication is non-negotiable, please let me know what alternatives might be available, as I am not comfortable proceeding under these terms. Thank you for your time and continued support.

The doctor has declined to participate in the competency examination. As the exam was ordered by the court, two possible paths come to mind; fist, you have mentioned that you are in therapy and have been seeing a doctor; perhaps he/she will be willing to undertake the examination given your parameters, if he/she qualifies to do so under the statute, (see Massachusetts general laws chapter 123 section 15(a); he/she would also have to be a vendor with the commonwealth of Massachusetts to be compensated; something you may want to check into. The second path involves you being examined at the courthouse on November 13, and if you choose not to answer any questions, the doctor assigned may report to the court his/her opinion based on whatever information he/she may have or obtain. Should the court ultimately find you competent, we can select a trial date; should the court find you not competent , the case will be suspended pending periodic reviews of your abiliity to stand trial. As to evidentiary issues, thank you for the contact information, and either I or the investigator will be in touch with them. You may want to give each a heads up to expect contact from either of us. Thank you also for the transcript and hearing found on you tube regarding the October 14 2021 restraining order hearing, clearly showing that Ms Nichols did not vary her sworn testimony from what se told the police and wrote in her statement. It will not be necessary for impeachment . I presume you are aware that the order expires on October 15, and I likewise presume you will be present at East Brookfield to address that issue; remember that you will be under oath should you testify, and that anything you say about the incident can be brought up at your subsequent trial.(I only point this out as part of my job, as I presume if anything you will reiterate your denial of the assault, and in any event I doubt the district attorney is even be aware of the hearing, and even so, I doubt she will be in at

I spoke to my therapist, and unfortunately, his license does not cover this type of evaluation. Therefore, the court will need to find a doctor who is willing to allow the evaluation to be recorded. I’m also unsure why my competence is being questioned again. I had no issues with the first evaluation, answered all the questions asked, and the evaluator never questioned the validity of my responses or suggested I was being unreasonable. I wish I had known about the victim witness statement that Beth wrote before my previous competency evaluation. Attorney Bergo never informed me about it, unless the ADA failed to provide him a copy. I only found it when Attorney McGinty gave me all the paperwork he had. Regarding Olivia and Sue, I haven’t spoken to Olivia since before the alleged incident, and I haven’t spoken to Sue in over a year. I don’t believe it’s appropriate to contact either of them at this point. I informed Attorney Banks that I wanted the restraining order recording because Beth lied to the judge about my father supposedly saying she could have the apartment and that I wasn’t allowed back. That’s one reason I asked for an investigator. Additionally, Beth lied about being unaware of my past restraining orders. At the time, my so-called criminal history was a hot topic, and Beth had been encouraging me to get my record expunged. She wanted me to be co-guardian for her son, Stephen, and openly talked about it with many people. In fact, we discussed this the morning of October 4th, 2021. Unfortunately, my father passed away in June 2022 before he could give a statement. Attorney Banks never tried to contact him or advised me on what steps I should take. I was under the impression that having my father help me get the restraining order removed because of Beth’s lies would have supported my alleged assault case, especially since the police didn’t gather any evidence or take statements to back up the allegations. No pictures were taken, and the o

i assume the competency exam will proceed according to path b as i described. This exam was ordered by the court, and I do not know why. Given your reluctance to proceed, I'm guessing the next doctor will review the January 24 report and form his/her opinion. Upon your representation regarding Olivia and Sue, I shall refrain from making contact with them. As you point out, no pictures of Beth were taken, the officer did not notice any bruising, and put any redness etc. down to her being emotional and crying, which is not unusual when couples have heated arguments. Someone fleeing the police is unlikely to take their dog with them; it's more likely they left the premises to walk the dog and allow things to cool off. You said nothing incriminating on the booking video, and, even if they do or did exist, how would the dashcam or bodycam videos assist in the defense? Had you told the police that you struck Beth, rest assured that they would have put that in their report. Rack your brain to see if there is anything helpful to your defense to be gained by looking at videos of your arrest and ride to the police station; if there's nothing, there's no reason to show them. If you have a distinct recollection of being told about the existence of bodycam footage, please be more specific as to the date and time and persons involved; otherwise this is a dead end, although I will inquire of Attorney Burgos and the Distract Attorney. Keep in mind that the defense has no burden of proof; the commonwealth must prove each element of the case beyond reasonable doubt; we don't have to provide any evidence. Their evidence thus far consists only of Beth's representations to the police, (her written statement is inadmissible); no photos, no medical reports, no observations of obvious bruising; no realistic flight from the police, no incidents while you were arrested, and no incriminating statements. take care, will be in touch

I’m totally willing to do this competency evaluation, I only require it to be recorded. Using the previous one would be highly inappropriate at this juncture. As far as body cams Both officers informed me they were wearing body cams the day of my arrest, they arrived in two separate vehicles, I spoke with both officers at length, I can’t recall their names after all this time. My sister was already on her way to get me at that point, I had texted her, so they waited until she arrived. she grabbed my dog, before I was taken to the station. April 2022 Attorney Roger Banks told me he received those recordings and wanted to set up a date to listen to everything together. He spoke to me about how he went over parts of the recordings and he heard officers speaking with Beth and who he believed was Sue, Attorney Banks questioned why I sounded so worried about my dogs safety when officers placed me under arrest. I haven’t been able to get anyone to talk about that body cam footage since. I assume something was said that proves I shouldn’t have been arrested in the first place. I didn’t know it at the time, but my hyperthyroidism was acting up again, that’s why I sound so pathetic and was unable to speak up for myself when this all started. Shouldn’t police have been required to gather some form of evidence to support their probable cause to arrest me? There isn’t protocol for such events? Pictures, videos, medical attention since we all know that adrenaline can mask injuries. From my perspective, police kidnapped me, drove me miles away from my intended destination and extorted money out of me, threatening to keep me behind bars if I didn’t pay them. There was zero evidence to support what Beth said, I wasn’t a threat to her or anyone else. There was zero justification for them putting their hands on me, I didn’t put my hands on anyone else. Officers knew I have disability and I told them that I was in pain from a severe migraine and my genetic muscle

No pictures were taken, and the officers, who both told me they were using body cams at the time of my arrest, later claimed they couldn’t operate them. This also doesn’t explain what happened to the camera inside the vehicle, which was the same setup as when officers took me to the emergency room in 2016. I was recently told they weren’t required by law to record at that time, but I distinctly recall being told that the body cam footage did exist.




Is there any way to find out if it was deleted?




I first requested all body cam footage in October 2021 and witnessed the ADA in Worcester handing Attorney Bergo a CD in December of 2023. I believe I’ve been more than accommodating and am within my rights to express my concerns.




I will, of course, be in court on October 15th to address the restraining order.

Dear Attorney Grady,


 


                If you are asking whether there is a video from a body-worn camera, there is not. I spoke with the Warren Police Department and the only video evidence is the booking video. I am not in possession of a transcript of the restraining order hearing from the East Brookfield Court. The evidence that I am in possession of is listed in the notice of discovery that I provided to the defendant and was provided to prior counsel before the case was transferred from East Brookfield. I did provide the same packet of evidence to you and I included the previous competency evaluation.

i forwarded your email of 10/03 to Attorney Banks 10/4 and have received no reply. The two officers mentioned in the report regarding your arrest are named Bouchard and Laflower. The District Attorney reports that she is unaware of any video beyond that of your booking. Again, given that you said or did nothing to hurt your defense, I don't see any point in pursuing this issue. As you were charged with a domestic assault and battery, be advised that an uncorroborated statement by an alleged victim is enough to provide probable cause for an arrest, ((see Domestic Violence Law Enforcement Guidelines, 1917, Section Eight, pages 26-27, available on line). The lack of any additional evidence, (photos, medical reports, etc.), goes to the strength or weakness of the investigation. (I have never understood why an officer wouldn't use his cell phone to document injuries, but I'm not in charge of that.) I am interested in the route you took with your pup. I gather from your You Tube videos that you enjoy the woods, and I am curious as to whether or not the route you took on October 4 was a regular path for your pups walk, or a deviation? How far is your home from Route 67, and would that path be circular, such that you would eventually end up back home? Would Beth be able to answer questions about your regular habits and routes while walking the dog? I ask because this may show the fact finder that you weren't evading the police, just walking the dog to cool off after an argument. My appointment does not include tomorrow's hearing at East Brookfield, but I wish to point out that you will be under oath and the less said about the 10/04/21 incident (except a general denial, if appropriate), the better. (Again, I doubt the D A will investigate, but Beth will likely inform her of what goes on.) Assuming you have had no contact with her for three years, and have located to another city, you may wish to point out that there has been no recent allegations of abuse and that furtheran

I walked north on South st and took a left on to 67 heading towards Palmer, I had a migraine at the time, Beth knew it and she also knew I was headed to my mothers house 18 miles away in Springfield, because I told her that’s where I was going. That’s where I always went when she had these episodes, though this is the first time I ever walked out like this. I wasn’t able to get cell service until I was miles away. I left the house at 9:08am according to the security cam picture and the text I sent my sister didn’t get through to her until 10:20am. I was 5 or 6 miles away by the time police found me at about 11:04. Thankfully my sister arrived shortly after they did, since my dog was terrified. I told officers before they informed me they were gonna place me under arrest, that Beth seemed like she was having a nervous breakdown, the abuse her son suffered was getting to her and I told them she had blocked me in our middle bedroom and refused to let me leave, until I picked my dog up and she changed her mind allowed me to exit. That I never touched her or tried to move her out of the way. I’ve been told that police should have charged Beth with kidnapping for holding me against my will in that upstairs middle bedroom. That a man wouldn’t be allowed to get away with a stunt like that. I was also told Beth should’ve been charged with theft for taking my backpack and refusing to give it back. Kinda hard to prove I said that stuff to officers without those body cam recordings. At least the security cam picture shows I don’t have my backpack , which had my knee, elbow, ankle braces, tooth brush, adhd medication, gloves, telescopic fishing pole, lure box, poncho, fpv drone and it shows I wasn’t running from the house. I’m concerned that body cam video was deleted or just isn’t being handed in. In a previous case I had, an Ada passed in a fake receipt and also claimed it was paid for out of the victims own pocket. Then I found out it was all lies, I lea

Restraining order was extended, once I saw Beth at the courthouse, I already knew the judge was going to extend the order before we even got up there. Massachusetts doesn’t treat men and women equally when it comes to restraining order decisions. The previous restraining/harassment order I had placed against me, was after I tried to get one against the girl who drove into me while racing around without car insurance. I tried reporting her crimes and getting an harassment order against her for messages she sent and deriving by my house, but because she had family in the courts, my harassment order was turned against me. I was told to stop trying to report her crimes. I know I was discriminated against today, I know there’s nothing I can do but hug my dog and go about my life. It’s heartbreaking and unrighteous the way men are treated in Massachusetts, I understand it’s just the way it is, but it doesn’t make it any less disappointing and to think I used to think our legal system was something to be respected, oh well. Beth being able to block my exit from a room for 30+ minutes, at times threatening to call the cops if I try to push her out of the way, then telling me that if I leave, she’ll never stop and that she hopes that I do kill myself this time. Speaks volumes to how disgustingly one sided things are in our court system. What happened to people with morals and ethics? Imagine if I did still had suicidal thoughts? Beth knew about my 6 past suicide attempts, she knew I saw therapists off and on and had a prescriber, I had been trying to figure out for years why my life would be going great, then I would just fall apart with no explanation. I took Beth to some of my drs appointments, so she knew that I experienced these nervous breakdown type events and knew I wasn’t violent, but I was self injurious at points. It wasn’t until after this alleged incident with Beth and after my father died of cancer June 2022 that I found the pattern I was looking

Had you discussed Beth's actions with any prior counsel? I can inquire of the District Attorney as to whether or not Beth has told her this; If she acknowledges such conduct, then she may have a 5th amendment right not to testify, and if she invokes that right, your case is likely to be dismissed. Please advise as to how you wish to proceed, as you are on record as saying you have no intent to "attack her".

Message Body

﻿Yes, I’ve discussed being locked in that bedroom with Attorneys Banks, Dicato( on the phone), O’Doherty and Bergo. Attorney Banks told the ADA about this on the day he asked for money for an investigator and Attorney Bergo told the Worcester ADA about this in December of 2023 after asking for that first competency evaluation and asking her about the body cam footage. I don’t think Attorney McGinty was aware of this, I was focused on trying to gather evidence at that point and constantly being reminded of this traumatic event and being forced to relive it every time I have to talk about it, is very unhealthy for me. 


Beth keeping me trapped in that middle bedroom was one of the major reasons behind Attorney Banks asking for money for an investigator in the first place and then for me constantly urging the other attorneys I was assigned to get an investigator to speak to the witnesses I originally listed. Unfortunately for me, no one was ever spoken to, even though I was granted the money to accomplish this task by the courts, no one took anything I said seriously or bothered to follow up on anything I said. 


This was the second time in our relationship that Beth followed me into a room, closing a door behind us, refusing to allow me to leave and threatening to call the police if I bumped into her while trying to get by. 


The first time something like this happened was in May of 2021 and after this, Beth told multiple people how she felt I did bump into her while I was trying to leave our bedroom, even though she was purposely blocking the exit. She was having a hard time because of things going on with her son and she didn’t want me to leave the house.  I stayed this first time and she worked through her issues. Beth told multiple people I had no right to try to get past her. 


This second time on October 4, 2021, I made no attempt to get by her or move her out of my way, I just kept repeating- I wanted to leave and she kept saying said that she’d call the cops if I pushed her out of the way. I was in no condition to stay or debate any subjects, it wasn’t until I picked my dog up, right after Beth told me she hopes I kill myself this time, since I wasn’t listening to what she had to say, that she allowed me to leave the room. 


The commonwealth shouldn’t be allowed to dismiss my case after everything I’ve been forced to endure. They shouldn’t be allowed to play stupid and pretend that they didn’t know that this happened to me and allow this case to be dismissed 3 years later.


The whole point of me pushing to get copies of that body cam and vehicle audio was to prove I told officers this stuff in the first place. If I had known I wasn’t being recorded during my arrest, I would’ve talked more inside the police station. You can hear me talk in that police station booking video about how officers in the past aided a woman who was committing a crime, all because she had family working in the court system. 


Which brings up the question, what types of evidence are police officers allowed to ignore? 

How long are police officers allowed to turn a blind eye to crimes being committed by people right in front of them, before they’re held accountable for their failure to uphold our laws?

Am I honestly supposed to believe that both of those officers that day couldn’t operate their body cams properly? That these devices are that confusing to operate?  

This body-cam footage would be completely damaging to the commonwealths case against me.

Am I honestly expected to believe that both officers were incapable of activating their body-cams that day?  



Beth knew that the last 3 times I tried to kill myself in 2015-16 had been because of the all stress the commonwealth had caused me(and things were probably made worse by being misdiagnosed and prescribed medication that made also worsened my symptoms), from the different organizations that helped cover up a girl driving without car insurance, then the person assigned to my case ADA Johnston created a fake receipt and used it as evidence to claim that a window was paid for, when in fact she was flat out lying when she claimed this driver paid for the window out of her own pocket, I learned through my own investigation that the window wasn’t paid for at all, that driver skipped out on the bill. I learned the statement I typed up, had notarized and handed to an ada after my arraignment was altered by someone in the DA’s office to omit things the police officers who arrested me said to me and that I had documented. 

Then I was framed by these people for forgery and coerced into pleading guilty after having some old man place a gun to my forehead, right inside the hallway to my lawyers office in Northampton, all because I uncovered these crimes and people wanted it all swept under the rug. All because I made a big stink about being denied medical attention, police didn’t want me finding out that girl was driving illegally. 

This is a disgusting pattern of behavior by the commonwealth, don’t pay attention to any of the crimes we’re committing, just focus on the false allegation made against myself.


 The point of the investigator was to prove Beth wasn’t telling the truth and had a pattern of this erratic emotional behavior. 


1. Beth lied to the judge about me elbowing her and about my father saying she could have our apartment and that he said I wasn’t allowed back.  

My father and I wanted her to get help. We were under the impression that speaking to an investigator about this would help my case and get Beth the help we felt she needs. He died from cancer in June 2022, before giving a statement. 


2. Beth still owes me $10,000 for all the work I did with her son and the damage she caused to my car. She told multiple people about this and it was recorded in emails we sent on behalf of Beth’s son. 


3. Beth told all her friends and our mutual friends that she wanted me to be co-guardian of her son Stephen, because of all the positive work I was doing with him and for him. At this time she was also pushing me to get my record expunged, since the commonwealth violated my rights and broke the law to gain those convictions. These conversations were had with everyone we know, I never shut up about how corrupt our legal system and worthless our state and local leaders are. I’ve told people about all the issues I’ve had.


4. Beth has told numerous people about the time she thinks I bumped into her while trying to exit our bedroom, even though she was purposely blocking the door. 


5. Beth spoke to people about all the severe stress she was under because of the abuse that was allowed to continue happening to her son. She felt helpless and responsible for his continued suffering in these Massachusetts funded groups homes. 


6. I asked for copies of those emails that I sent on Beth’s behalf, in these emails it’s evident that the state ignored all of our concerns about the safety and well being of Beth’s son Stephen and other disabled people in the care of the organizations I contacted. These emails I sent show a pattern of behavior by the state and its associates that caused Beth severe anxiety, emotional distress, countless sleepiness nights and caused problems in her personal relationships and in our relationship.


I am totally against the commonwealth being allowed to dismiss my case, they (police officers, Ada’s, court appointed lawyers) have a history of tampering with evidence, withholding evidence, turning a blind eye to serious crimes, helping people commit crimes, ignoring people’s mental health issues, denying people medical attention. 


I want a trial, even if Beth doesn’t testify, I should still be able to present witnesses that Beth has displayed this type of behavior in the past. I should be able to show jurors that police arrested me without gathering any evidence to back up their so called probable cause claim, when they had the tools necessary with them. Citizens have a right to know this disgusting behavior is going on and how trying to do something about it is a horrible uphill battle. I thought our legal system was supposed to set an example, not destroy the public’s trust. 

Allowing the commonwealth to dismiss my case after all these years and after ignoring everything I’ve been saying since day one and after putting me through all these nonsense and forcing my disabled ass to drive back and forth to court for nothing, just to be given new dates to return, is an abuse of power, abuse of a disabled person( Myself). This is disgusting unconscionable behavior and it shouldn’t be tolerated. 


Also concerning this competency evaluations. It seems to me that the true purpose behind this second request is not to genuinely assess my mental capacity, but rather to delay proceeding and divert attention away from the serous legal and ethical violations I have brought to light.


The issue at hand is not a question of my competency, morals, ethics or logic. Instead, I believe the court is attempting to shield itself from accountability, given the laws I’ve shown to be broken and the crimes I have shown to be committed. This is not a case of confusion or doubt about my mental state- this is an evasion of the truth.

Subject: Re:

 

Restraining order was extended, once I saw Beth at the courthouse, I already knew the judge was going to extend the order before we even got up there. Massachusetts doesn’t treat men and women equally when it comes to restraining order decisions. The previous restraining/harassment order I had placed against me, was after I tried to get one against the girl who drove into me while racing around without car insurance. I tried reporting her crimes and getting an harassment order against her for messages she sent and deriving by my house, but because she had family in the courts, my harassment order was turned against me. I was told to stop trying to report her crimes. I know I was discriminated against today, I know there’s nothing I can do but hug my dog and go about my life. 


It’s heartbreaking and unrighteous the way men are treated in Massachusetts, I understand it’s just the way it is, but it doesn’t make it any less disappointing and to think I used to think our legal system was something to be respected, oh well. 


Beth being able to block my exit from a room for 30+ minutes, at times threatening to call the cops if I try to push her out of the way, then telling me that if I leave,  she’ll never stop and that she hopes that I do kill myself this time. Speaks volumes to how disgustingly one sided things are in our court system. 


What happened to people with morals and ethics? Imagine if I did still had suicidal thoughts?  Beth knew about my 6 past suicide attempts, she knew I saw therapists off and on and had a prescriber, I had been trying to figure out for years why my life would be going great, then I would just fall apart with no explanation. I took Beth to some of my drs appointments, so she knew that I experienced these nervous breakdown type events and knew I wasn’t violent, but I was self injurious at points. 


It wasn’t until after this alleged incident with Beth and after my father died of cancer June 2022 that I found the pattern I was looking for and No it never involved hitting or putting my hands on someone else. I’ve hurt myself in the past, which I’m sure is unsettling enough to people as it is, but I’ve never put my hands on woman or tried to force them to talk to me by preventing them from leaving a situation they feel is making them uncomfortable. 


It’s unfortunate that no one around me paid enough attention to what was going on to see that my thyroid was off again.

I go from being confident, assertive, a real problem solver,  to being low energy and I won’t stick up for what’s right, I just run away from any issues, simple tasks seems impossible and I tell people what they want to know and answer questions without thinking of the consequences. Which unfortunately is what led to Beth calling police and lying about me elbowing her. I’m positive that stuff I said to her broke her heart and she had no clue why I left, we weren’t having any issues at all, so from her point of view, I just abandoned her and wanted out for no reason. 


Which brings me to something else I was told, it was mentioned we should have had a judge with a psychology degree presiding over our case. I can’t recall exactly how it was worded. 

Seeing that Beth appears to be suffering from delusions still.


In all the times I’ve tried to hurt myself, I’ve escaped the hospital twice, I tried to strangle myself two different times, years apart and while locked in different psych wards, during these events I was having an irrational fear of being confined.

Yet I’ve never put my hands on people or tried to hurt anyone, other than myself. 


At age 9 while in Catholic school I was locked in a utility closet throughout the day most school weeks,  I was let out at times, but it traumatized me, this was a driving force behind me getting Beth’s son out of the closets at the school he was in years ago. I was passionate about helping in situations people like me. 


There are three options here.

1, I hit Beth for no reason and I’m a liar

2. Beth is a bold faced liar.

3. Beth is delusional and this situation was too much for her and she made up this story to deal with it.


I’m going to go with 3, I know the courts won’t look into anything or investigate any claims and they don’t care about Beth’s mental health or anyone’s really. But I’ve felt she’s needed help since the day this happened. Under normal circumstances I wouldn’t have needed to get out of the house and away from her. I would normally talk to her until she passed out, it was totally unlike me to refuse to debate a topic with her. 

I know the courts are going to try to claim Beth wasn’t under any stress and she didn’t have any reasons to make up a story, but that’s only because they don’t want the whole truth. 

I’m not going to call her a liar without telling the entire story behind what happened. I never would’ve left the house that day if I was healthy, but I wasn’t and I unfortunately can’t control my desire to flee these types situations when my thyroid is off.  


That judge today is sexist, it sends a message to men that we don’t have a right to walk away from women if a situation is making feel uncomfortable or unsafe. We have to stay and take the abuse or risk being arrested without any evidence. What kind of state do we live in?

I walked north on South st and took a left on to 67 heading towards Palmer, I had a migraine at the time, Beth knew it and she also knew I was headed to my mothers house 18 miles away in Springfield, because I told her that’s where I was going. That’s where I always went when she had these episodes, though this is the first time I ever walked out like this. I wasn’t able to get cell service until I was miles away. I left the house at 9:08am according to the security cam picture and the text I sent my sister didn’t get through to her until 10:20am. I was 5 or 6 miles away by the time police found me at about 11:04. Thankfully my sister arrived shortly after they did, since my dog was terrified. 


I told officers before they informed me they were gonna place me under arrest, that Beth seemed like she was having a nervous breakdown, the abuse her son suffered was getting to her and I told them she had blocked me in our middle bedroom and refused to let me leave, until I picked my dog up and she changed her mind allowed me to exit. That I never touched her or tried to move her out of the way. 


I’ve been told that police should have charged Beth with kidnapping for holding me against my will in that upstairs middle bedroom. That a man wouldn’t be allowed to get away with a stunt like that.


I was also told Beth should’ve been charged with theft for taking my backpack and refusing to give it back.  


Kinda hard to prove I said that stuff to officers without those body cam recordings. At least the security cam picture shows I don’t have my backpack , which had my knee, elbow, ankle braces, tooth brush, adhd medication, gloves, telescopic fishing pole, lure box, poncho, fpv drone and it shows I wasn’t running from the house. 


I’m concerned that body cam video was deleted or just isn’t being handed in.

In a previous case I had, an Ada passed in a fake receipt and also claimed it was paid for out of the victims own pocket. Then I found out it was all lies, I learned I was denied medical attention to cover up a girl driving without car insurance and I did try to report it, but that girl has a sister and cousin who happen to work at the Hampden county court house. So not only was there a conflict of interest, especially seeing a notarized statement I handed in was altered without my consent, but the police and ada violated the Brady disclosure by continuously denying me the name of her car insurance company, cause they knew she didn’t have it at the time of this accident.


I find it disgusting that this prosecutor is going to ask a jury to believe an officer, who is willing to risk ruining someone’s life and potentially getting them tossed in jail for up to two and a half years, but that same officer isn’t willing to take a picture or get statements from nearby potential witnesses to support this charge. Laziness? Indifference?


The judge who approved this restraining order never asked Beth about her injury or made any notice of redness on her face. Whether from being hit or from being upset, you would think someone would note something like that, if they witnessed it. 


Attorney banks said the commonwealth change these domestic assault charge requirements because regular citizens were complaining that to many people with money were getting away with abuse, so they made it super easy to arrest citizens without any evidence or any witness statements to support these assault claims.


To me to is disgusting, immoral, unethical, unacceptable behavior by the commonwealth.

i forwarded your email of 10/03 to Attorney Banks 10/4 and have received no reply. The two officers mentioned in the report regarding your arrest are named Bouchard and Laflower. The District Attorney reports that she is unaware of any video beyond that of your booking. Again, given that you said or did nothing to hurt your defense, I don't see any point in pursuing this issue.


 As you were charged with a domestic assault and battery, be advised that an uncorroborated statement by an alleged victim is  enough to provide probable cause for an arrest, ((see Domestic Violence Law Enforcement Guidelines, 1917, Section Eight, pages 26-27, available on line). The lack of any additional evidence, (photos, medical reports, etc.), goes to the strength or weakness of the investigation. (I have never understood why an officer wouldn't use his cell phone to document injuries, but I'm not in charge of that.)


   I am interested in the route you took with your pup. I gather from your You Tube videos that you enjoy the woods, and I am curious as to whether or not the route you took on October 4 was a regular path for your pups walk, or a deviation? How far is your home from Route 67, and would that path be circular, such that you would eventually end up back home? Would Beth be able to answer questions about your regular habits and routes while walking the dog? I ask because this may show the fact finder that you weren't evading the police, just walking the dog to cool off after an argument.


   My appointment does not include tomorrow's hearing at East Brookfield, but I wish to point out that you will be under oath and the less said about the 10/04/21 incident (except a general denial, if appropriate), the better. (Again, I doubt the D A will investigate, but Beth will likely inform her of what goes on.) Assuming you have had no contact with her for three years, and have located to  another city, you may wish to point out that there has been no recent allegations of abuse and that furtherance of the restraining order is unnecessary, particularity in light of the stay away order that is part of the criminal case. Please keep me informed and good luck.

So whether Beth has a Fifth Amendment right or not, I will not press the issue if you don't wish me to do so; if it does come to light, it will be up to her to decide whether to invoke it or not, but I conclude that you do not wish to pursue this possible avenue of defense. Please let me know if I am in error on that. If you do wish to see her held accountable for such conduct, the only avenues I see are to contact the Warren Police and make a complaint, (kidnapping and larceny from a person are felonies, and the statute of limitations for being charged is six years), or go to the East Brookfield District Court and seek a private complaint through a magistrate's hearing. I don't know how successful either route would be, but that's all I have. This morning I phoned the Warren Police Department and was told that Officer LaFlower is no longer employed there, and is now in Florida. The Lieutenant I spoke with assured me that in 2021 the police department did not have bodycam. That should be the final word on its availability. I understand both Chief Millette and Officer Bouchard will be the only officers testifying. Although I doubt it will exercise it, The Commonwealth has the absolute power to discontinue the prosecution of this case. Look up the term NOLLE PROSSE and also read the case of Commonwealth vs. Michael Cheney, (type in 440 Mass. 568, click the entry from JUSTIA and see page 573). I remind you that my role here is not to put the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on trial for events in your past, but to have you acquitted of the criminal charge against you. I intend to do this as simply as is reasonably possible, and i again point out that without Beth's testimony, this case cannot proceed. Your best chance for an acquittal is simply her lack of testimony, but even with it, the scarcity of corroborating evidence works in your favor. Your trial is not a forum to redress grievances against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and I am not going to treat it as such

I really wish you would’ve emailed the Warren police instead of speaking on the phone. I really want someone to look into this now. The Officers who arrested me both said they had body cams on at the time of my arrest, that I was being recorded in the vehicle also, both on the ride to the warren station and on the ride to the state police barracks, I was told that they were recording me inside the warren police station, I don’t recall if state police said they recorded me. Attorney Banks told me that he received the body cam footage and we were going to set a date to meet at his office to listen to it, that never happened. I questioned Attorney Bergo about this and he was always vague with his responses. So I called the warren police department while at the worcester court house, I was told on the phone that Warren police officers were wearing body cams that day, even though it wasn’t required by law at the time, they were testing out the devices. Attorney Bergo heard the phone call I made, I followed the officers instructions the officer gave me and emailed her with my request. I drove to the Warren police department that same day and filled out a paper version, asking for all audio and video from the day of my arrest October 4, 2021 and I also asked for the recordings from my 2016 trip to the E.R. that warren police gave me as well. The officer at the station told me that there must’ve been an issue with the recordings from October 4, I can’t recall his exact words, but those bodycam recordings weren’t there. He didn’t mention vehicle recordings, so I assumed I would at least get a copy of those. I never heard back about my request for any of those recordings, I was told I would receive a cd in the mail and still nothing. Now over three years later, you’re telling me these officers are saying they never had body camera or vehicle cams on at all. This is maddening, totally unacceptable behavior. Thankfully I have a therapist to talk to about all thi

I do not share your distrust of those involved in the criminal justice system, so I don't need written verification of what was told to me by the Warren Police regarding the bodycam. Feel free to email them yourself and see how they respond. I am curious about the state police involvement in your arrest, as I have received no evidence or reports describing it. Did you go with them to the barracks before or after your arrest and booking at the Warren police department? I'm curious why they would be involved at all, and the District Attorney informed me that she had no information about them. Perhaps you can contact the Brookfield and /or Sturbridge SP barracks, (I assume either would have jurisdiction in that area) and see if an incident report exists; They didn't file charges against you, or they would be listed as complainant. Very curious, please, enlighten, but again, I don't see how the existence of any of their videos changes the defense position of making the commonwealth try to prove their case. Will you be obtaining and posting the recording of the October 15 restraining order hearing? As you had brought up Beth's actions, I'm curious if she responded to the accusation in any way. Your statement about them also allows me to bring the issue to the District Attorney's attention without breaching any attorney/client privilege, so the 5th amendment issue can be addressed (of course, if Beth simply denied your allegation, no basis exists to explore any 5th amendment rights she may have.) Comet was disappointing, but cool. Off for a day or so, please let me know if you contact SP or post hearing recording. take care.

I ordered the audio from the restraining order hearing and haven’t received it yet. I’ll put it online with commentary once I get it. 


I contacted the state police and the trooper I spoke to said he’s not sure if there was any body cam or other recordings inside the booking area at that time, but you could request it all and they’ll send whatever they have. He also said that I would need to go to court to address the kidnapping and theft charge after all these years. It’s horrifying how disabled people have to go above and beyond when trying to defend their rights. If you can’t request that State police footage, I will, just let me know. 


I contacted the Disability Law Center and I am waiting to hear back from them, perhaps they can help me with the kidnapping and theft charge against Beth. If not I will try to address it when I make the trip to worcester in November. 

I will also ask the DLC about an investigation into the warren police departments handling of the body cam footage. If they can’t help, I will try the FBI, since I have been told three different stories surrounding this footage, I’m not willing to go to trial until I have exhausted all of options investigating it. 

I rushed to trial over that malicious damage to a motor vehicle charge, since I didn’t attack that vehicle and I thought it was all a big misunderstanding, yet I was still found guilty with zero evidence against me. Then I found out that the evidence I had asked for would’ve changed my entire defense strategy. 


If you discovered that a assistant district attorney handed a fake receipt to a judge in a case and lied about it being paid for in one of your cases, I need to give me the contact information to who you would report that incident to.

Attorney Bergo heard the phone call I made, I followed the officers instructions the officer gave me and emailed her with my request. 


I drove to the Warren police department that same day and filled out a paper version, asking for all audio and video from the day of my arrest October 4, 2021 and I also asked for the recordings from my 2016 trip to the E.R. that warren police gave me as well. The officer at the station told me that there must’ve been an issue with the recordings from October 4, I can’t recall his exact words, but those bodycam recordings weren’t there. He didn’t mention vehicle recordings, so I assumed I would at least get a copy of those. 

I never heard back about my request for any of those recordings, I was told I would receive a cd in the mail and still nothing. 

 

Now over three years later, you’re telling me these officers are saying they never had body camera or vehicle cams on at all. 


This is maddening, totally unacceptable behavior. Thankfully I have a therapist to talk to about all this. 


You can see how this would drive someone with mental issues to hurt themselves. This is exactly how things went when I tried to get the name of that girls insurance company years ago , I learned that police allowed that girl to commit a crime.

Now you’re telling me that those police should’ve charged Beth for kidnapping and theft for what she did to me and once again police officers arrest the man that’s involved without any evidence and totally ignore what the girl involved has done and there’s evidence to support her committing a crime. 


I understand your position on the competency evaluation, though I don’t think you appreciate all the pain and suffering this type of nonsense causes me. Years ago the court sent me to what I can only describe as a Fake Anger Management class and made me pay for it, this was after that malicious damage to a motor vehicle conviction.

Now they’re pushing these nonsensical competency evaluations upon me and not because they actually question my competence, but because I actually look at the big picture and pay attention to details. 


I already know I’m not going to get a fair trial, the state is going to try to limit everything I say and distance themselves from any blowback


As far as Beth’s 5th amendment rights, you can mention this stuff to whoever you need to. I don’t like secrets or surprises, I don’t imagine the courts do either.


I do think Beth needs to be charged, that type of behavior is totally unacceptable, but there’s zero chance of me going back before that East Brookfield judge again, during that restraining order extension hearing Tuesday, she made faces when I was talking about how Beth blocked me in that bedroom and wouldn’t let me leave. That Sexist judge thinks it’s okay for this stuff to happen to men. 


Should I call the warren police? Given the fact that I already told them the day this happened, I don’t see why they would all of a sudden care if I told them about it again. They obviously didn’t listen to anything I said. 


Take care, the foliage has been nice this year, if you have binoculars, look west after 6:30pm, that Comet should be brighter now that the moon isn’t so high in the sky.

 So whether Beth has a Fifth Amendment right or not, I will not press the issue if you don't wish me to do so; if it does come to light, it will be up to her to decide whether to invoke it or not, but I conclude that you do not wish to pursue this possible avenue of defense. Please let me know if I am in error on that.


If you do wish to see her held accountable for such conduct, the only avenues I see are to contact the Warren Police and make a complaint, (kidnapping and larceny from a person are felonies, and the statute of limitations for being charged is six years), or go to the East Brookfield District Court and seek a private complaint through a magistrate's hearing. I don't know how successful either route would be, but that's all I have.


   This morning I phoned the Warren Police Department and was told that Officer LaFlower  is no longer employed there, and is now in Florida. The Lieutenant I spoke with assured me that in 2021 the police department did not have bodycam. That should be the final word on its availability.  I understand both Chief Millette and Officer Bouchard will be the only officers testifying.


   Although I doubt it will exercise it, The Commonwealth has the absolute power to discontinue the prosecution of this case. Look up the term NOLLE PROSSE and also read the case of Commonwealth vs. Michael Cheney, (type in 440 Mass. 568, click the entry from JUSTIA and see page 573). I remind you that my role here is not to put the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on trial for events in your past, but to have you acquitted of the criminal charge against you. I intend to do this as simply as is reasonably possible, and i again point out that without Beth's testimony, this case cannot proceed. Your best chance for an acquittal is simply her lack of testimony, but even with it, the scarcity of corroborating evidence works in your favor. Your trial is not a forum to redress grievances against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and I am not going to treat it as such or proceed along that line. I hope we understand each other on this point.


   I take no position on the competency examination order, as I had nothing to do with it. I recognize it as a judicial order that must be addressed. and I attempted to accommodate the court without success.


  It appears that discovery is complete, so on the 13th we can likely choose a trial date once the exam issue is resolved. 

 Take care, enjoy the foliage

hi; could you check with the warren police, and whomever else, as to what involvement, (if any), the state police had in the defendant's arrest? He maintains that he went to their barracks and that they gave him a blanket. If they were involved at all, (happening to drive by and checking if assistancewas needed, or because the arrest was on a state highway (67), that they perhaps have jurisdiction over}, there should be some record, particularilly if they transported the defendant. A definite answer should resolve issues about bodycam or dash cam videos. I'm guessing the brookfield barracks, but perhaps Sturbridge or Charlton has warren in its path. Thanks, please keep me informed;  Second issue: Is there any indication of a 5th amendment issue for the alleged victim? It has been publicly stated that she would not let him leave the premises and confiscated his backpack; has she acknowledged this conduct?  Finally, the competency exam question  must be addressed on the 13th. I attempted to hire a private doctor, but he declined to participate . I did not seek this exam, so I imagine the court will order a further in court examination that day. Assuming competency is not an issue, I hope we'll be ready to choose a trial date. Thanks, see you soon. Be advised that all emails are being forwarded to the defendant.

if you want it, you should order any state police footage. Even if it exists, I don;t see how it assists in the defense. Any complaints that you are seeking against Beth as a result of the October 21 incident are in the jurisdiction of the East Brookfield District Court, and will not be entertained in Worcester in November. Hopefully you will have exhausted all investigative options by November 13,a after the Competency exam issue is resolved, I I will be reporting discovery as being complete for defense purposes.

I posted the audio from the restraining order hearing on YouTube. I stopped by the state police barracks on my way to east Brookfield court and spoke with troopers, they informed me that there isn’t any recordings from my time there, if there was, it was most likely deleted a year after, since they don’t save their recordings indefinitely and they didn’t make the initial arrest. You were correct, I was unsuccessful in my attempt to file charges against Beth for what she did to me, I’ve told that the commonwealth is going to try to sweep this under the rug because my statement, I also shared the statement I used in the details section of the restraining order video. I was told that Attorney Banks should have reported what Beth did to me and that his failing to do so has harmed my case. I was told my other lawyers also should have reported it, but I was told attorney banks behavior that is the most concerning because not only did he fail to report what happened to me, he was the one who requested money for an investigator after pointing his finger in my face aggressively telling me not to ask other lawyers for advice, because he was upset I was pushing him to have someone investigate my case. Then attorney Banks never sent an investigator to question anyone about Beth’s behavior, not even Sue or Olivia who were in the house at the time of this alleged incident, I was told I need to keep pointing out that this behavior also keeps me from having a fair trial. Especially since Beth went next door to speak to my step mother Sue before or right after she called police, I don’t recall which. Regardless Sue could’ve given a statement as to what Beth said to her or described if she heard anything, since she was 10 feet away at the time I left and all of our kitchen windows were open, Both mine and Sue’s. Our dogs would’ve gone nuts if I had even pretended to swing at Beth, let alone actually hit her and Sue would’ve relayed that info to officers. I’ve be

Someone placed a gun to my head and took the files I was bringing to my previous Attorney Elaine Pourinski. It happened in the hallway right outside her office, she was dealing with that forgery charge I was coerced into pleading guilty for. She was adamant that I don’t call 911 and report this incident to police, she claimed she was also terrified and there was nothing that could be done about this. She complained about her knee as well. This all came about because I discovered that ADA Katherine Johnston lied about that window receipt being paid for and that found the receipt was a forgery, then discovered that my notarized statement that I handed an ADA, was altered by someone in the Hampden DA’s office, I reported that springfield police denied me medical attention, that they deleted information off of my police report and that they aided that driver after she drove into me while I was walking, she was racing around with no car insurance, suspended registration and she had a rejection sticker for safety. I ran my mouth and told everyone at that court house I could, I called the Springfield police captain who basically ignored me, I reported it to state troopers and they gave me that girls suspended license and registration info, but didn’t help me do anything about it. I tried reporting this to the registry of motor vehicles , I called the attorney general and governors office. Magically no one ever knows who to report this kind of stuff to or how to hold these people accountable. Here I am disabled, I have the right to feel safe and free from harm. I have the right to leave situations I feel are hostile. No one has the right to hold me against my will or try to force to do what they want, when they want me to do it.

In paragraphs 4-9 of your 11/8 email you state you were told several things about the law, procedure, and the power of a district court judge to order investigations; I'd like to contact whomever told you these things. Free legal advice is worth what you pay for it, and it's available everywhere. I am still waiting for a response from the district attorney to my email to her last month. You mentioned that Sue was in the house, but you also told me earlier not to locate her, as she may not be helpful to the defense; is that still the case? Will she be able to testify unequivocally that you didn't stike Beth and /or that Beth wouldn't let you leave and confiscated your back pack?  Only you can answer that, but if you do want her to testify, we will need to locate her for summons purposes. Thanks for the transcript of the R O hearing, it provides significant information for cross examination purposes. See you tomorrow, room 23; i understand you may be arriving around mid-morning; You have my cell if anything comes up.

Beth knows I have to listen to my body, I’ve had over a dozen joint surgeries, a disc replaced in my neck, a rod placed in my forearm. She was there for most of these.

Beth knows my hyperthyroidism causes me to become physically weak, very low energy at times.  

Beth knows all about how my genetic muscle disorder causes my muscles to break down easily( genetic form of rhabdomyolysis), this can damage my kidneys if left untreated when I over do it, she knows to many repetitive motions with any joint gives me tendinitis, which has been documented and treated with surgery and injections multiple times. She knows that I have knots in my shoulders, neck and jaw that have never gone away,  you can easily see the swelling in my right side of my face. 



Now my rights are once again being disregarded and your only concern is of who could be informing me of these Laws I need to understand and question? 

I can place these emails online and we can see if anyone wishes to reach out to you or if they can choose to comment publicly. 


 There is still the competency evaluation the judge ordered, I find it hard to believe that this judge would only focus on me and not on the misconduct of anyone else involved. 

I can also bring up the issues of mandated reporting with this evaluator. 


Let me know what you think.

Our dogs would’ve gone nuts if I had even pretended to swing at Beth, let alone actually hit her and Sue would’ve relayed that info to officers. 


I’ve been told that my judge could and should order an investigation into these officers and Attorney banks behavior, since I was told what Beth did to me is also considered a hate crime under mass chap 265, section 13K, she knew I was physically disabled and was hoping to scare me into staying by threatening to use the police to hurt me, she was trying to force me to stay, knowing that my disability issues, previous injuries and surgery sites would be severely aggravated by being placed in handcuffs. Beth also didn’t warn police I was physically disabled in her 911 call, I thankfully warned Warren police officers and although they didn’t take my statement and ignored what Beth did to me, they were very gentle with me and my dog when I explained how bad my issues are. Which doesn’t excuse them not taking my statement and possibly lying about that body cam footage, but they weren’t total monsters, just lazy. 


I was told that my lawyer could request police body cam logs, that officers have to follow specific protocols when using them and there’s a paper trail to track. That simply taking an officers word for it doesn’t cut it.

Especially since I myself have been told 3 different stories and something like this happened to me before in Hampden county district court. I wrote a statement and had it notarized because police didn’t take my statement about what happened and denied me medical attention, I wanted people to hear my side.  then I handed that notarized statement to the first ADA I met after my arrest, I found out around a year later that someone in the district attorney’s office altered my statement by deleting pages and electronically signing my name, all because I wrote what officers said to me in it and how they denied me medical attention, but I also wrote an address they told me, so I knew they accessed CJIS, they knew that driver was committing a crime at the time and officers decided to cover it up.


So I believe that it’s possible Warren police deleted that audio because it implicated them in a hate crime, I told warren officers Beth was holding me against my will, refusing to let me leave, then she was threatening to call the cops, that she said she’d never stop and that she told me she does hope I kill myself this time. Beth is well aware that I received disability for a closed period because of past mental health issues, before getting placed on it permanently for the genetic muscle disorder. Beth knows I had spent multiple times in a psych ward for attempted suicide, we talked about this with my family multiple times. The warren police know about my suicide attempts, they brought me to the ER the last time I was suicidal. So both Beth and the Warren police know I’m not violent and have a history of hurting myself. 


I told both the warren police and those Brookfield troopers about Beth taking my backpack and refusing to give it back, I even tried pleading with them about the fact that I didn’t try to snatch it back from her because she constantly talked about having physical issues and I assumed she’d claim I injured her if I tried to yank it away, plus I myself didn’t want to get injured, I have enough issues already, so I left without it. 

I remember how hurt I felt when officers wouldn’t grab my backpack from her, they told me I had to wait for court and speak to my lawyer. State troopers offered the same advice, oh well she took my stuff, just live with it. 

I was told police should’ve recovered my backpack because it had my medication in it. Beth even acknowledge I was on medication in her 911 call and that picture police obtained from the neighbors shows that I don’t have my backpack with my medication.


I was told that police don’t have a right to ignore a disabled person making kidnapping and theft claims, that they were required to take my statement and should’ve charged Beth, that refusing to do their jobs that day was a violation of my rights and prevents me from having a fair hearing. What Beth did to me was assault, she put me in fear of having the police hurt me, then the warren officers came and followed her instructions and they put their hands on me, which made it assault and battery. 


I was told to ask if Attorney Banks should’ve excused himself over a conflict of interest because he was dealing with an abuse case in the same house Beth’s son lived in and I had filled multiple reports of abuse and neglect on her sons behalf.

Complaints to Office of Bar Counsel

I got your response from the investigator, I’m surprised Oliver/Olivia would lie about being in the apartment. I know for a fact she was in her room, she’s the reason I didn’t finish the dishes the night before this alleged assault. And it’s in Beth’s impact statement.


I can see Sue saying she wasn’t in the apartment since technically she lived next door, even though she was in her kitchen when I left, less than 10 feet away, if I had elbowed Beth at the sink, she would’ve made some kind of noise or raised her voice for me to get out. That would’ve totally freaked our dogs out. My dog still doesn’t like if people play fight, she’ll bark like crazy.


Here are copies of the complaints I filed against attorneys Banks, O’Doherty and Bergo. I was told to mail these and my notes to the office of bar counsel. Hopefully this will prevent what happened to me from happening to other people too.


If you’re interested I can also forward you the emails I sent myself in October of 2021.


When I read all of this, I can clearly see how I drove Beth insane that morning. My hyperthyroidism causes personality changes that I wasn’t aware of at the time. I walked out on her for no real reason, I didn’t know I was having a panic attack at the time either and people were acting strange, so I can see how in that moment I felt like the world was crashing down, everything was doom and gloom and I just needed to get away.


I didn’t want to start fights or argue with anyone, I totally lacked any type of confidence that morning. Beth tried to reason with me, but I wasn’t listening.


As far as Beth is concerned, there was no logical reason for me to ignore her that morning, she had been an amazing girlfriend up until I stopped listening to her when talking about my father and she got super frustrated and started saying horrible shit. But I just ignored it. She was trying her hardest to get me to argue with her, she wanted me to tell her what was wrong, give her something more to go on, cause up until that morning things were great. But I just repeated things she had said.


Beth was always high strung as it was, she’d been through a lot and my running off was a nightmare come true. I know I caused her to have a panic attack too that morning. The things she was saying and the gestures she made while struggling to get me to talk are clear to me now, I say this  cause I knew her for 5 years.

There was no immediate issue to address that day, but she wanted to continue talking and I felt like I needed to leave. Neither of us would give.


Which looking back with a healthy mental perspective is totally heartbreaking.


Beth and I used to talk about everything, we talked about our hopes, our dreams, our nightmares and we had plans for the future. I never ignored her, I always encouraged her to talk and share her feelings. We used to talk for hours on end. I never said it was over or I couldn’t take things anymore, when Beth need space, I gave it to her, when she wanted to talk, I was always there.


I was warned about putting to much of my defense online. Slippery slope I’m walking here. But ever since day one I said Beth seemed like she needed a mental health evaluation because of the way she was acting and things she was saying that morning. Now I know I can prove it, unfortunately it’s because of the way I was acting and the things I said. I never touched her and she never touched me. If she did, it might’ve snapped me out of it.


Beth had been through a lot and was barely holding it together as it was, her son was being neglected at his new home, then there’s the stuff in victim impact statement you said isn’t admissible, but I am going to use it.


Beth and I were best friends until I ran out on her and she lied about being elbowed. Now that I’m healthy, I feel like the courts are trying to force me to fight my best friend, but the courts and previous lawyers are the ones who have caused me the most stress and my case the biggest problems. I’m lucky to be alive given my past mental health issues.


I also feel like someone should alert her therapist or have her therapist there in court for her when I say all this stuff.

olivia/oliver is lying, as ricky correctly points out that her mother's impact statement puts her inside the apartment that morning, although upstairs. Apparently, she has no interest in getting involved, and while i don't doubt that she was upstairs, her lack of presence in the kitchen neither helps nor hurts the defense in any way. Good work; trial assignment/compliance date 1/8;  hope you and yours enjoyed christmas.

Thank you for keeping me informed. I will appear by zoom and text you if I have any issues logging in tomorrow. 


I am very disappointed Warren police haven’t responded by now, they’ve had audio and video recording devices in their vehicles since at least January 2016, along with the body cameras they were wearing in October of 2021. I don’t understand how they are unable to provide paperwork showing training and/or maintenance/installation logs  for these devices.  


There must be other instances where the warren police department used body cam footage to defend its actions or convict someone in other court cases. 


A crime was committed against me and police officers made things worse by ignoring me when I reported what Beth said. She should’ve been charged and wasn’t. I spoke to police before and after they read me my rights. 

I find this highly concerning because police know I’ve been suicidal in the past, they acknowledged this fact in my police report under caution type.  I’m not listed as violent or aggressive or a threat to anyone, they only listed suicidal. The stress from this situation could’ve caused me to become suicidal, this is totally crazy.  


I agreed to give police a statement, I didn’t exercise my right to remain silent and magically nothing was documented or recorded. Police only wrote about Beth in their report. I had a lot more to say than she did. 


This is also the second time I’ve had an issue obtaining a recording involving police officers. The first was trying to acquire a copy of my release footage from the Springfield police station years ago. So I’m not really surprised there’s another long standing issue being dragged out.

Sorry to hear about your back. I have also been to the drs recently over lower back issues, so I can empathize with your pain. At times I can barely walk to the bathroom. This cold weather causes me a lot of pain and cramping,  this wind has been brutal lately, so it’s been a challenge staying active.


I am very interested in reading this written policy response from the warren police department and hearing your strategy. I’m sure I’ll have questions. 


I hope you’re able to work your back issues out soon.

in my vulnerable state Wednesday i forgot to inquire whether Beth was asked and/or had any response as to whether she prevented Ricky from leaving the premises at any time that day, and/or whether she confiscated his back pack. These allegations were made by Ricky at the restraining order hearing in October of this year, and Ricky maintains he also made them when arrested, although neither police report reflects that.

Good morning; updates and trial prep time. I know you've been in criminal court before, but as that was some time ago, I'll go over some basics.First, I'm sure you know that as a defendant in a criminal case, you are presumed to be innocent, have an absolute right to remain silent and make the commonwealth prove each element of the charge against you, and that you have absolutely no burden to prove innocence or provide any testimony or evidence. Your trial can be in front of a jury or a judge. With a jury, six people chosen by you and the commonwealth will hear the evidence and be instructed on the law. (The selection process begins with a number of people having been summonsed for duty that day being brought into the courtroom; we have an index card with some basic information about each one; we can challenge any 3 for no reason, and 3 more for cause, as can the d a; ( in this case, the only thing I would be leery of is anyone that might have had prior issues with domestic abuse); seven are chosen, although only six get to deliberate.)Their function is to listen to the testimony and view any evidence presented. They will be instructed that the d a has the burden to prove each element of the crime you are charged with beyond a reasonable doubt. They are also instructed about your lack of burden to prove anything, your right to remain silent and force the government to try to prove their allegations, and what the term reasonable doubt means. At the close of the evidence and after closing statements, they will retire to deliberate. Their verdict is either GUILTY or NOT GUILTY, and must be unanimous. You may also decide to have the case heard and decided by a judge alone, who knows the law and its burdens, but will make the decisions about the strength and weaknesses of the evidence presented, and ultimately, whether the da has proven the case. This is totally your decision, as is your decision to testify, and it's not something in my judgment that you can decide until

I’ll leave Harley home. I still feel like she is evidence in my case. Her behavior would show jurors how she doesn’t like violence, but she’s also kind of heavy and my back wouldn’t enjoy carrying her for hours. I am right handed. If I’m not going to testify, I’d be very interested in the questions you’re going to ask police and Beth. Seeing there’s zero physical evidence to suppose this claim and I wasn’t mad at Beth when I left that morning. I was having a panic attack and afraid. She knows my mental health history and knows I’ve never been violent towards others and she’s very aware of the times I hurt myself. Police didn’t take statements from anyone at the scene about noise or pictures of Beth’s alleged injuries, so they were just going through the motions. They had to arrest me no matter what once Beth made that phone call and claimed I elbowed her. Her phone call and statement are probable cause, there was no physical evidence to support her claim. Beth had a laundry list of physical issues at the time and she never once complained that they were aggravated by this alleged assault. She didn’t try to push me away when I pinned her against the counter, then elbowed her. I always wondered if she’s claiming I hit her while her back was turned. Her story lacks so many details.

good choice on Harley; i wll let you know the new date when we get it, i expect to hear Monday; we agree about the lack of evidence they have; i only ask questions of witnesses if their answers can help us in some way, for example clarifying that the chief saw no injuries and that you were pleasant and cooperative with officer Bouchard, (many batterers are shitheads and act that way); i may ask Beth if you are right handed. keep warm; nice video sliding with Harley

I think I sent you the first email, but this is the entire thing anyway. Please tell me I’m not imagining things. He totally talked around the questions he would ask police and beth. Not that it’s a huge issue, but everyone knows I need details. He mentions the video of me sledding with Harley, but didn’t mention the video about the pretrial hearing and the crazy description.

I am right handed. 


If I’m not going to testify, I’d be very interested in the questions you’re going to ask police and Beth. Seeing there’s zero physical evidence to suppose this claim and I wasn’t mad at Beth when I left that morning. I was having a panic attack and afraid. She knows my mental health history and knows I’ve never been violent towards others and she’s very aware of the times I hurt myself.


Police didn’t take statements from anyone at the scene about noise or pictures of Beth’s alleged injuries, so they were just going through the motions. They had to arrest me no matter what once Beth made that phone call and claimed I elbowed her. Her phone call and statement are probable cause, there was no physical evidence to support her claim.


Beth had a laundry list of physical issues at the time and she never once complained that they were aggravated by this alleged assault.


She didn’t try to push me away when I pinned her against the counter, then elbowed her. 


I always wondered if she’s claiming I hit her while her back was turned. Her story lacks so many details.

Good morning; updates and trial prep time. I know you've been in criminal court before, but as that was some time ago, I'll go over some basics.First, I'm sure you know that as a defendant in a criminal case, you are presumed to be innocent, have an absolute right to remain silent and make the commonwealth prove each element of the charge against you, and that you have absolutely no burden to prove innocence or provide any testimony or evidence.  Your trial can be in front of a jury or a judge. With a jury, six people chosen by you and the commonwealth will hear the evidence and be instructed on the law. (The selection process  begins with a number of people having been summonsed for duty that day being brought into the courtroom; we have an index card with some basic information about each one; we can challenge any 3 for no reason, and 3 more for cause, as can the d a; ( in this case, the only thing I would be leery of is anyone that might have had prior issues with domestic abuse); seven are chosen, although only six get to deliberate.)Their function is to listen to the testimony and view any evidence presented. They will be instructed that the d a has the burden to prove each element of the crime you are charged with beyond a reasonable doubt. They are also instructed about your lack of burden to prove anything, your right to remain silent and force the government to try to prove their allegations, and what the term reasonable doubt means. At the close of the evidence and after closing statements, they will retire to deliberate. Their verdict is either GUILTY or NOT GUILTY, and must be unanimous.  You may also decide to have the case heard and decided by a judge alone, who knows the law and its burdens, but will make the decisions about the strength and weaknesses of the evidence presented, and ultimately, whether the da has proven the case. This is totally your decision, as is your decision to testify, and it's not something in my judgment that you can decide until you know what judge may be hearing the case.  I will advise you about this and whether to testify on the trial date, but both of those calls are yours.


   I understand both the Chief and Officer Bouchard will be available to testify, as well as Beth. From the chief I expect to estaablish that he saw no injuries on Beth, and that she explained her red face by tears and a rash. He can verify, if necessary, that the alleged stroke was reported to be to her lower right jaw area.  Officer Bouchard can attest that he met you on route 67, (in the direction of Springfield via 20), that your sister came and picked up Harley, that your arrest was uneventful, and in fact that you were both cordial and cooperative, as is shown on the booking video.


  I expect Beth will testify as is reported by the chief; areyou left handed? It occurs to me that a strike in the lower right jaw would more naturally come from a left arm than the right. An intentional strike would more naturally come from your more active arm; just something that occurs to me. I don't intend to get into great detail about the cause of the argument or any subsequent court hearings and I don't want to bring up any restraining order evidence (a judge can discount such evidence, but a jury or juror may be concerned that a court issued an order against you). My intention is to keep this as simple as possible , focusing on October 4, 2021, and make the commonwealth try to prove their case, which in my judgment, is weak.


  I don't suggest that you testify or offer any evidence. The only purpose of your testimony would be to deny the allegation, which you have already done so by pleading not guilty. If you take the stand, you are subject top cross examination, and there is no need for you to put yorself in that position. Keep in mind you need to prove nothing.


   Please dress well, so that either the judge or jury knows you ae taking this seriously; this also conveys respect.


   I don't suggest bringing Harley, although neither myself nor the d a have any personal objection. Be prepared to verify that Harley is a "service animal" rather than an emotional support pup, as I understand there is different criteria, and you may have a problem with the officers at the doorway; I would bring medical verification thar Harley's presence is needed if you bring him/ her, but I suggest frankly that she not attend; she may distract jurors, and we don't need that.


   That's what I have for now; going over some stuff, we can touch base just before trial or whenever you like. Stay warm.

i've just reviewed his latest you tube post summarizing his view on the state of this case. Despite his aspersions as to your integrity, Mr. Stebbins has publicly posted that he trusts no one involved in this case, so I believe we should all do our jobs as best we can, knowing that. I suggest we inquire of the police as to existence and/or records of dashcam footage in 2016; ( I would be amenable to a zoom or 3 way call if that will satisfy everyone; I don't know if the chief was even on the force then, but there should be some record or absence thereof that can put this issue to rest). While the defense has no burden of proof, and I always believe that the less evidence presented to a fact finder the better, Ricky obviously sincerely believes that the dashcam existed in 2016, (and I have no reason to think he's not sincere in this belief),  so perhaps some information can be found to address this issue. Thanks, I'm writing this on Saturday, ln know you won't see it till Monday.

Warren body cam response

I received the Warren Police Departments response you mailed me. I am very disappointed to see this is just their Policies and Procedures. I feel like this should’ve been given to you before court, so I could have viewed it and made any comments. I don’t believe this is what was said in court the other day and it doesn’t actually settle the question. This paperwork implies officers were using body cameras after July 1, 2021 for training purposes, before being required to wear them full time March 2022. It doesn’t state they weren’t wearing them. There is no mention of their training dates or if officers used them after their training was complete to keep in the habit, even though it may not have been officially required yet. Just because they weren’t required to officially start using bodycams until March 2022, doesn’t mean that they weren’t required to keep and hand over the videos made during their training period. The fact that the officers were training at the time wouldn’t exclude these videos as evidence at trial. Officers both told me they were wearing body cams and recording when they approached me, this paperwork doesn’t claim they weren’t wearing them and weren’t recording when I was arrested. I find this type of behavior by court representatives and these types of responses highly concerning and intentional. It erodes public confidence in state employees to do their jobs appropriately and effectively. Warren officers documented me being suicidal in their police report, I assumed it was from the first time I was transported by them to the hospital in 2016. They had audio and video recorders in their vehicles at this time, yet there’s no mention of this in their generic policies and procedures. Where is their old policies and procedures? Not the new July 2021 updated version. This is concerning to me because officers approached me parking on the wrong side of the road and activated their lights, so that should’ve triggered the ve

I know you want to make this simple, but I’m not going to ignore that mumbled dash-cam comment. Ada White knows that’s a lie and she intentionally misled that judge. 


Even if those officers body-cams both magically failed to activate, which I doubt. The in-vehicle system was functioning. 


Where is the in-vehicle policies and procedures paperwork?


Ada White knew about the in-vehicle system when attorney Bergo told her by the elevators 1-10-2024. I told Bergo the warren police came to my house after I escaped the emergency room after a suicide attempt. I hide in the first floor closet and then officers placed me in protective custody. One officer told me I was lucky he didn’t shoot me because there was a machete on the floor in the closet. That caused me to panic even more. When we got to the vehicle, it had a recording system, I asked the officer all about it and then I told him about the issues I was having in Hampden county court. Knowing I was being recorded January 19, 2016 was a huge relief, since I was so sick at the time. I tried to commit suicide 3 times within 4 months.  I talked the entire ride back to the emergency room in Palmer. 


This story was one of the reasons attorney Bergo requested that competency evaluation. Along with telling me Beth said the “abuse of her disabled son” that I’ve been talking about didn’t happen. Ada White told him Beth claims I made it up. This is why I wanted those emails. I really thought that competency evaluation was because people thought I was losing my mind. 


This behavior on ada Whites part is malicious and intentional. She’s been jerking me around since I was transferred to Worcester. 

Which still hasn’t been explained to me. East Brookfield is less of a hassle for me. 


White stated she called the day before court last month. She knew I wanted things on paper. I should been given time to read that policies and procedures before court. Judge Ginsburg said some things and I know her instructions weren’t followed.

I asked for dash-cam footage documentation to be in writing back in December of 2023, attorney Bergo dragged his feet after giving me a speech about things needing to move ahead swiftly in July of 2023.

Then he and ada White jerked me around on 1-10-2024 by requesting a competency evaluation. 


I added a picture of a email with attorney McGinty. Not to be rude cause he’s your friend. But he should’ve looked into ada Whites statement. Leading me to believe it could be false, then doing nothing about it. He could’ve had someone go to the station and take a video of the program and the date in question. Problem solved. 


Pics are out of order, but there’s 4 pics 1 to Alex, 1 from Alex, 1 from McGinty.


I added 1 of the email I sent to warren police on 1-10-2024, to show judge Ginsburg I been doing my own leg work since January 2024 and I’ve been getting nowhere.


I also drove to the warren police station and requested “in writing” all footage from 10-4-2021 and the ride to the emergency room on 1-19-2016. I never got a response back. No explanation, nothing.

Before I begin again, I would like to thank you for following up on all of this the way you have. I do appreciate it. 


In order to make this simple; here are 4 things I would like and why. This should help streamline everything.


1 • I would like someone to take a video while they use the Warren police departments computer and scan their program for any body-cam, dash-cam and in-vehicle recording device uploads. I’d like this video to cover 5 different dates.


1.1 • Dash-Cam or In-Vehicle recordings from 9-30-2015 and 1-19-2016


1.2 • Body-cam, Dash-Cam or In-Vehicle recordings from October 4, 16 and 24, 2021. 


These first two videos cover my second trio of suicide attempts. With the first of these attempts on 9-30-2015. Warren officers arrived at my home at 176 south st and then I was transported to the Ware emergency room by ambulance after cutting myself.

Then the third of this trio/my last ever suicide attempt on 1-19-2016, two warren officers arrived at my home, placed me in protective custody, then one officer gave me a ride back to the emergency room in Palmer, since I had escaped and went back home to Warren. I saw myself on the dash screen during this trip back, it displayed the in-vehicle camera the warren police were using and the officer described how it recorded audio and video when I asked. I didn’t notice if a camera also pointed outside also. I was just worried about my safety inside the vehicle. I wasn’t under arrest, he didn’t treat me like a prisoner, but he did warn me I was lucky he didn’t shoot me in the closet. I had drank some rat poison, but I didn’t feel any worse than I did before drinking it. My memory was still functioning just fine. I was suffering from a panic attack from hyperthyroidism and drs hadn’t made me aware I even had it yet. 


Regarding the 2021 footage.

If there was body-cam footage from the 2 officers who arrived at South st 10-4-2021 and spoke with Beth, it would really help my defense to get an idea of her state of mind. It would show how she looked, we could hear how she sounded. Was Beth still holding my backpack when officers arrived??? Did Beth say anything to officers that cast doubt on her 911 elbow statement or did she say anything to implicate herself in a crime? Did Beth tell officers she hopes I kill myself??? Did Beth display signs of suffering a mental health crisis? 

Police told me Beth claimed I elbowed her “by accident”, did Beth really say that? Why didn’t police take pictures?  All things that could be answered by that footage.


— I was told by attorney Banks that he received this body-cam footage and it showed officers speaking with Sue Stebbins who lives next door in apartment A. I would like to know if Sue did speak to police and if she said anything that helped my situation. I’m surprised police didn’t document anyone else being in the house —


2• Can someone ask Sue if she remembers speaking to those officers on 10-4-2021 or if Beth said anything to her before or after calling police that would led a jury to believe that accidental elbow event didn’t happen?



I wasn’t paying attention, but officer Guzik might have been wearing a body-cam on 10-16-2021. That day I had paid for an officer to stand watch as my family and I packed my things for 3 hours. 


Officer Guzik was also the responding officer when I returned on 10-24-2021 to exchange some final items with Beth, both happened at 176 South st. Did officer Guzik call in her miles like other officers do? We would hear this in any in-vehicle or body-cam footage.

There should be a record of these events being recorded, nothing being recorded or if this footage was deleted after being uploaded. If the program doesn’t keep a record of deleted footage, that would be a huge problem. If that’s the case It could’ve been stated and proven years ago, then I could’ve moved on.  


3• I would like this 911 alert I received explained. (Picture attached)


I received this 911 alert on my phone 10-24-2021 from number (413) 310-4993. attorneys Banks, ODoherty and Bergo all said they’d find where the call originated, if the call was cut off before it got through to dispatch or if police or dispatch responded to this call in any way. I told these attorneys I believed Beth used one of her sons devices to attempt to get me to contact her or get me to have an officer pass along the alert message. At the time I thought Beth was testing to see if I was mad at her or if I would help her son and tell someone. The alert popped up on my phone as I waited for an officer to arrive so I could drop off her stuff. There’s a reason why I didn’t tell officer Guzik about the alert when she arrived, if there’s a recording of this event, you’ll hear what she said to me. 


4• I would also like written proof from  Beth stating that she told ada White that her son wasn’t abused and I didn’t send any emails on his behalf. 

That was a major reason I agreed to take that competency evaluation. I actually took a step back and considered I could’ve imagined my relationship with Beth, because I was sick at the time I walked out and I didn’t know it. Though I’ve never hallucinated before, I considered it, since my behavior does change.

These emails were part of the discussion I had with judge Ginsburg on 8-5-2025. Ada White stated that day “she thinks she’s aware of what I’m asking for.” Of course she’s aware, she told Alex Bergo on 1-10-2024 that Beth said I made those emails and abuse stories up. 


I don’t ever want to go before a judge again without proof I did everything humanly possible to gather and request every piece of evidence I believe I am entitled to have for trial, to do so in writing and to explain why, just as judge Ginsburg stated. I don’t know what my previous attorneys issues were. But I did try doing things their way and it got me nowhere. 


If there’s any issues with these 4 things, computer video, Sue questions, 911 Alert explanation and written email/abuse comment verification. We have weeks to 


I only added one pic , it’s of that 911 alert I received from one of Beth’s son’s devices, I don’t recall the location displayed on the screen when I received this alert. This was the first and last alert I’ve ever received from him, even though you can still see his location, so I haven’t been removed as an emergency contact.

This isn’t just about ada White. Those officers should have charged Beth that day. They chose not to. Officers read me my rights in the road and I agreed to continue talking. This isn’t reflected in any of their reports. We were in the road talking for almost 20 minutes. They waited for my sister to arrive to pick up my dog. 

I used this time to plead my case. I told officers I didn’t hit Beth, she didn’t hit me. She followed me around downstairs saying I should hit her if I’m so unhappy. Then followed me upstairs and held me against my will for a half hour or more. Then told me she’s gonna call the cops and say I hit her, she’ll never stop and she hopes I kill myself. 

All in an attempt to get me to stay. 


Beth snatched my backpack hoping it would get me to stay and talk with her. 


Those officers knew Beth had my backpack. I told them what happened.  We drove past my street on the way to the station and I asked that officer if he could grab my stuff, I needed my medication and my dogs medication, but the officer said I’d have to speak to my lawyer about it. I was a mess and thought it was super unprofessional not to allow me to have my property back. 


Officers wouldn’t even tell Beth to give my backpack to my stepmother or father who lived next door in apartment A. I expressed how important that pack was to me. 


Beth went through all my stuff and pre-packed a lot of my things before I was able to speak to my lawyer about how to get my things back. At the time I felt Beth did that to upset me. 


I told officers Beth was suffering from some sort of mental health crisis. She was acting childish and wouldn’t stop. 


I didn’t realize at the time that she was having a panic attack because the things I was saying to her were a total shock and came out of nowhere. 

Granted she should’ve seen the signs that I was sick again, there were events leading up to this day where she could tell that I wasn’t feeling confident any longer, her child Oli even mentioned that I haven’t seemed as happy lately, Oli said this the night before this October 4 event.  



I believe that footage was deleted or being withheld because of my big mouth. I probably said a bunch of stuff that made it super clear that I was totally innocent and that officers should have driven back to South st to speak to Beth. 


If it’s discovered that the chief deleted that footage. He’s going to get in big trouble. 


I want the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

I have serious problem with ada Whites behavior.  She also intentionally failed to inform me that my trial date was put off last august.


I was supposed to have trial 8-5-2024. A few weeks before this date,  a friend in the courts informed me I wasn’t going to be having trial, it was put off and ada White was heard laughing saying “ he’s suicidal, I hope he leaps over the railing.”  She wanted me to look stupid in front of all my friends and family, wasting everyone’s time driving out to Worcester from Springfield. That’s why I told all my other witnesses not to show up and only brought my nephew. That really pissed a lot of people off and they still aren’t talking to me. 


When I arrived to court with my nephew, he got to hear the shameful excuse ada White had some other woman give me. White wasn’t adult enough to say it herself. Yet she was smiling away when I was told how “no one could find my contact information.”

Even though it’s clearly listed on my police report multiple times, along with suicide.


This behavior is malicious and intentional. When Hampden county lawyers and court officials found out I was suicidal in 2015, they purposely screwed with me, dragging my case out, until they had a guy place a gun to my forehead, then they were able to coerce me into pleading guilty for that bullshit forgery on my record. Even though everyone knows I didn’t create that paper, everyone knows I didn’t need it.


Plus for 5 years I gave Beth my word I would do exactly what I’m doing now, hold state workers to the highest standard, question every lie and pursue the truth no matter what. 


I blew so much fucking smoke up that poor woman’s ass. I made Beth believe we could accomplish anything together and I would help her with her son no matter what. then I got sick and she begged me to stay, but I wouldn’t, I didn’t know I was sick from my hyperthyroidism and I didn’t know I was having a panic attack, so I left with my dog. I had never ignored Beth’s concerns in such a careless/selfish way before, I never walked away from a conversation that was about other people. If I believe I am right, I will debate you until all of the facts are on the table. I wouldn’t dismiss you and never talk about that issue again. Plus I knew Beth has separation anxiety, I had given her my word I would never leave the house in the middle of something that bothered her. I knew how horrible her panic attacks were, but I walked out on her anyway that morning. I wasn’t thinking straight and felt she was verbally attacking me about issues that weren’t my fault, when she was really pleading with me to listen and help her.


Beth even wrote in that 10-18-2024 victim impact statement, she felt like she had been living a lie.


If I was abusive? How could she be living a lie? 

Beth’s statement is a contradiction of itself and is important to show her mental state. 


Beth inadvertently gave me an another chance to face the commonwealth, Beth didn’t force anyone to withhold evidence or lie to me about gathering evidence or speaking to witnesses. Didn’t didn’t tell police to skip gathering evidence, like other officers also skipped gathering evidence when her son was assaulted multiple times.


Roger Banks had a client in that house where Beth’s son lived and laughed about how bad things were. I had filed multiple reports of abuse/neglet on her son’s behalf and even voiced concerns in a email sent 2 days before I walked out.  Banks violated the conflict of interest laws, he should’ve dismissed himself as soon as he realized the connection. I clear he intentionally stalled everything after receiving that Warren footage. We spoke about it the same day he ordered the money for an investigator. Thought he hadn’t finished listening to the recording st that point. 

I find it concerning that I’ve never been contacted about the last neglect reports I filed. I am innocent until proven guilty, so there’s no reason I couldn’t have verified the abuse and neglect going on in those group homes. 


This is obviously an emotional topic for me, I treated Beth and her son like we were best friends for life and said it out loud all the time. Then that last day I felt empty inside and thought I wasn’t happy with her anyone because of the way our conversation went. So I left after telling her not to contact me again, granted that was after she told me she hopes I kill myself for wanting to leave. 


I can’t handle stress “at all” when my thyroid is off, I am a total coward and also become physically weak. I even abandoned my own kids because my thyroid issues and I didn’t even realize why I had left until 2022, 20 years after I last saw them. 


Now that I’m healthy again and on top of things, I owe it not only to myself, I owe it to Beth and her son to do the greatest job I can.  


Something is really wrong with my case and it’s been going on since day one, I can’t and won’t let this go. That would make a terrible citizen. Especially since I feel healthier than ever and my mind is sharp as a tack. I’m very passionate about doing the right thing, no matter the obstacles. I’ve had a lot of ups and downs in my life because of health issues, but I’ve never been violent, I’ve only hurt myself or tried to kill myself, not that I can explain why my mind chooses to go there when my thyroid is off. But it’s better than hurting other people. 



I added two pics and circled the info I found relevant. It’s obviously that my walking out on Beth when things were great in our relationship, but were bad for her son in his group home, traumatized her and is still very troubling for her. 


Hope you have a good weekend

I've just reviewed your you tube post and will email attorney white about your 2016 incident. The chief was an integral part of the 2021 event, and he can be questioned about what he knows about the dash cam from 2016, (I don't know if he was even on the force then, but records of such capability at least should still exist, if not the footage, I still believe the lack of dash cam or bodycam footage does not affect your defense, as no one is alleging that you did or said anything at the scene of arrest or rides to the station or barracks that would implicate you in the charge of assault and battery against Beth, (the sole reason you are before the court), but I will suggest Attorney White follow up on the dashcam situation, (2016 and 2021); the chief can explain why the bodycams weren't filming, despite being worn, which I also think is strange; will keep in touch

Subject: Re: Warren body cam response

 

I know you want to make this simple, but I’m not going to ignore that mumbled dash-cam comment. Ada White knows that’s a lie and she intentionally misled that judge. 


Even if those officers body-cams both magically failed to activate, which I doubt. The in-vehicle system was functioning. 


Where is the in-vehicle policies and procedures paperwork?


Ada White knew about the in-vehicle system when attorney Bergo told her by the elevators 1-10-2024. I told Bergo the warren police came to my house after I escaped the emergency room after a suicide attempt. I hide in the first floor closet and then officers placed me in protective custody. One officer told me I was lucky he didn’t shoot me because there was a machete on the floor in the closet. That caused me to panic even more. When we got to the vehicle, it had a recording system, I asked the officer all about it and then I told him about the issues I was having in Hampden county court. Knowing I was being recorded January 19, 2016 was a huge relief, since I was so sick at the time. I tried to commit suicide 3 times within 4 months.  I talked the entire ride back to the emergency room in Palmer. 


This story was one of the reasons attorney Bergo requested that competency evaluation. Along with telling me Beth said the “abuse of her disabled son” that I’ve been talking about didn’t happen. Ada White told him Beth claims I made it up. This is why I wanted those emails. I really thought that competency evaluation was because people thought I was losing my mind. 


This behavior on ada Whites part is malicious and intentional. She’s been jerking me around since I was transferred to Worcester. 

Which still hasn’t been explained to me. East Brookfield is less of a hassle for me. 


White stated she called the day before court last month. She knew I wanted things on paper. I should been given time to read that policies and procedures before court. Judge Ginsburg said some things and I know her instructions weren’t followed.

I asked for dash-cam footage documentation to be in writing back in December of 2023, attorney Bergo dragged his feet after giving me a speech about things needing to move ahead swiftly in July of 2023.

Then he and ada White jerked me around on 1-10-2024 by requesting a competency evaluation. 


I added a picture of a email with attorney McGinty. Not to be rude cause he’s your friend. But he should’ve looked into ada Whites statement. Leading me to believe it could be false, then doing nothing about it. He could’ve had someone go to the station and take a video of the program and the date in question. Problem solved. 


Pics are out of order, but there’s 4 pics 1 to Alex, 1 from Alex, 1 from McGinty.


I added 1 of the email I sent to warren police on 1-10-2024, to show judge Ginsburg I been doing my own leg work since January 2024 and I’ve been getting nowhere.


I also drove to the warren police station and requested “in writing” all footage from 10-4-2021 and the ride to the emergency room on 1-19-2016. I never got a response back. No explanation, nothing.

Subject: Warren body cam response


﻿

I received the Warren Police Departments response you mailed me. I am very disappointed to see this is just their Policies and Procedures. I feel like this should’ve been given to you before court, so I could have viewed it and made any comments.



I don’t believe this is what was said in court the other day and it doesn’t actually settle the question. This paperwork implies officers were using body cameras after July 1, 2021 for training purposes, before being required to wear them full time March 2022. It doesn’t state they weren’t wearing them.



There is no mention of their training dates or if officers used them after their training was complete to keep in the habit, even though it may not have been officially required yet. Just because they weren’t required to officially start using bodycams until March 2022, doesn’t mean that they weren’t required to keep and hand over the videos made during their training period. The fact that the officers were training at the time wouldn’t exclude these videos as evidence at trial.  



Officers both told me they were wearing body cams and recording when they approached me, this paperwork doesn’t claim they weren’t wearing them and weren’t recording when I was arrested.  



I find this type of behavior by court representatives and these types of responses highly concerning and intentional. It erodes public confidence in state employees to do their jobs appropriately and effectively.



Warren officers documented me being suicidal in their police report, I assumed it was from the first time I was transported by them to the hospital in 2016. They had audio and video recorders in their vehicles at this time, yet there’s no mention of this in their generic policies and procedures. Where is their old policies and procedures? Not the new July 2021 updated version.


This is concerning to me  because officers approached me parking on the wrong side of the road and activated their lights, so that should’ve triggered the vehicle recording systems. The officers told me their vehicles still recorded when I talked about my last suicide attempt with them. I was walking in the river side towards rt 20. 



Is there anyway to see when this suicidal report entry was placed into their system. If it was entered 2016 then it was an old threat assessment. If it was from October 2021, then the only way police would’ve known was hearing it from me. 



Also Beth spoke to Sue before calling police. When Beth followed me out of our apartment, I thought she turned back because of the rain. But Sue told me that Beth went into her apartment and although I can’t recall what Sue claimed Beth said, Sue told me and I quote  “I told Beth I didn’t want to hear it, I’m not in the mood and to take it somewhere else”. I’m not the only person Sue told this story to. 


Attorney Banks also stated he heard Sue tell this exact thing to officers, he said it sounded very harsh and probably made Beth more upset. Banks also said he heard Sue tell officers this wasn’t the first time Beth made false claim of bumping into her. He was very excited and looking forward to listening to the rest, he said this case was  a piece of cake.


I found Sue’s responses terribly hurtful myself, so I can just imagine how Beth felt. This was harder to deal with when I was sick, you can hear me whining about Sue in the restraining order audio. After court I called my Dad whining and crying while he was at work. Since I was sick, I really believed in that moment that my dad and sue were turning on me because of what Beth said under oath. I felt It was bad enough Sue blew Beth off, now I thought my dad was letting Beth have my apartment , I must’ve sounded like an idiot cause I accused my Dad of telling Beth she could have the apartment and telling her wasn’t allowed back, just like Beth told the judge. ( which was another piece to the puzzle and my figuring out what happened with Beth that morning and spoken to my therapist about)


attorney Banks told me he received a copy of the footage to my face and talked about the things he heard and it was obviously long, so he didn’t get a chance to finish listening to it all when he last spoke about it. Then he refused to talk about it again, same thing with my other lawyers.


Where are the training videos?  


Why won’t officers put an answer in writing? Not send a generic policy they have on hand. 


Is the Ada going to say objection when bringing up the fact that Sue told Beth she didn’t want to hear it, before Beth called police? 


I added a link to the Massachusetts  Law Enforcement Body Camera Task Force - recommendations from 2020 in case you’ve never seen it. I’m sure warren followed some of the recommendations for training 



There’s nothing in this about officers being able to lie to members of the public about being recorded, when you’re really not.  I couldn’t find anything about it in any mass laws. Under most circumstances telling a suspect he’s being recorded would get him to shut up. 


No one has said anything about contacting Beth’s therapist and making sure she has someone there to support her during this trial. I don’t think she’s going to handle all this very well. I was with her for 5 years, so I know her a little bit.

Hi; our efforts to locate officer Laflower were unsuccessful and he will not be appearing Friday. I also understand that no bodycam or dash cam have been acquired from warren pd, and the evidence will consist of the testimony of Beth , the chief and officer Bouchard. please review my email from 2/18, (I can resend it if you like), regarding trial prep/ procedure etc. I'm out with family stuff most of tomorrow, but if you want to touch base by either coming to town or zoom, (or email), let me know and we'll arrange a time. I expect we'll be the first case sent out for hearing, as we're coming up on 3 and a half years, so try to get to court early, (it starts at 845), room 23 (4th floor). Take care, see you soon.

Dear Sir or Madam: The above-listed matter was resolved in Room 23 of Worcester District Court on the morning of April 3, 2025. It had been transferred from East Brookfield District Court. Today I attempted to locate it on Mass CCourts and was unsuccessful . I checked both courts by docket number and the name "Ricky" instead of Richard, and was told in each case  NO RECORDS FOUND; please advise, as I would like to review and copy the docket sheet. Thanks, chris grady cell 774-239-7638.

I find this response concerning for all citizens


I asked for all footage from my lawyer Banks in October 2021. He said he got if 2022 the day he requested money for an investigation. Which means the East Brookfield ada also had a copy of this footage. 


Back in May of 2023 I was supposed to have trial, but attorney ODoherty showed up without gathering any evidence, witnesses and never gave me copies of this footage. 


Then I called the FBI, attorney general, the governors office, state police and reported that my lawyers and the courts were trying to pull some shit. 


I also spoke up in court about calling the FBI and I asked what was going and was ignored by that judge, this also in may of 2023.


December 2023 attorny Bergo Emailed me and said ada White will try to get body cam info in writing


I talked about this footage in my January 2024 competency evaluation. I told the woman I wasn’t sure if it existed; but I was told it did and there were ways to prove it, but no one would help. 

I also requested this footage myself by email and in writing at the police station. 1-10-2024


I filed complaints against my previous lawyers in January 2025. I also mentioned the footage I never received in these complaints and the issues I was having. 

 

February 2025 I posted that video calling ada White a liar when she mumbled past her dash-cam comment, but she went on and on about wearing body-cams, but not recording footage. 


April 2025 some footage magically appears days before I can go to court and prove that everyone has been lying about its existence. 


It’s strange that this lawyer, the same guy who just tried to get me to forget about all this and move on. Just spent an hour listening to a worthless recording, in a case he’s no longer involved in, because it’s been dismissed, yet he still hasn’t sent me a copy. 


I’m curious about the quality issues with the audio. There always seems to be some issues. Seeing that the warren police had these systems for years, I’m curious why these audio problems weren’t addressed?


After all the trouble I’ve gone through I don’t know if a “blank and incredulous look” really fits the narrative.

Your criminal case has been nolle prossed by the Commonwealth, and no further action is expected; however, you may consider bringing forward the case from Friday to avoid a physical trip to Springfield, and check Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 276 Section 100C for filing a petition to have the case expunged from your CORI.

Hi; so your criminal case has been nolle prossed by the commonwealth, which means it is dismissed and no longer active. Please refer to my earlier email wherein i described this process, keeping in mind that the decision to continue prosecution of a case is solely within the executive branch, (the D A), and neither the defense nor the judiciary can stop this. That's what happened this morning with your criminal case. In my 37 years of practice i have never lied to nor misled a client, and I'm not going to do that now. Here is what I know and what I've been told: On Monday attorney White confirmed by text to me that no videos were available beyond booking, and the evidence would be from Beth and the two police officers. I emailed you about that. Yesterday afternoon, (while doing trial prep). I got a text from her indicating that the Warren pd just had sent her a link (that she had difficulty opening) to of all things, the dash cam videos. (Your recollection was apparently correct; makes one wonder about the bodycam.) I invited her to join in my contemplated motion to dismiss your case based on the tardy, misleading and straight-out false response from the Warren pd. I don't know just what efforts were made by prior counsel to obtain these and all other videos, but as you know we clearly moved for these to be provided, (and this was so ordered), and attorney White reported on January 8, (in good faith I believe, although I know you disagree), that no such videos existed. I received another text from her shortly after my response about dismissal informing me that she had contacted Beth, who was not available this Friday and in all events was no longer interested in pursuing the case. Attorney White told me that the case was going to be nolle prossed. I suggested that we bring it forward from Friday so that you would not have to come in physically from Springfield just to go home again, ( i understood you to have transportation issues). Thar's what I know. I hope you we

After I publicly accused ADA White of lying, you would think she would have informed you that she personally filed complaints with the POST Commission against the Warren officers who misled everyone. If that had happened, I would owe her a public apology. But your email reflects no action taken by the District Attorney’s office against the Warren police chief or the officers involved in withholding evidence. We both know that if a defense attorney withheld key evidence, they’d face serious consequences. How is this not a Brady disclosure violation? How is the DA’s office allowed to ignore it? As a lawyer, don’t you have an obligation to ensure the law applies equally, regardless of who is breaking it? From the start, I told you this wasn’t a mistake—it was intentional. The facts behind my case’s dismissal should have been made part of the record, especially after everything I’ve endured, the pain this has caused me and my family. Judge Ginsburg even questioned my competency because of this nonsense—shouldn’t she have been made aware of these findings? I requested the dash cam recordings from the Warren Police Department by email and in writing on January 10, 2024—weeks before my first competency evaluation. I never received a response. The DA’s office claimed no such videos existed. Now, after accusations of misconduct, these recordings suddenly appear, the case is dismissed, and they still refuse to turn them over? That’s not justice—that’s evidence tampering. I still want those videos. Dismissing my case does not erase my right to evidence I legally requested. The Commonwealth has withheld and lied about evidence before. I was naïve enough to let it go once. I won’t make that mistake again. If I ignore it, how many other innocent people will be railroaded the same way? In 2015, I nearly took my own life after being subjected to this same legal manipulation. I’ve fought my way through it, but not everyone does. How many others hav

I am hanging with all I’ve got. My speeches haven’t inspired anyone to do the right thing yet. You’d think one lawyer would see that there’s a serious issue here and step up to help. They could take all the credit for addressing it and blame me for bringing it all to light. I know word about my case has gotten around the courts. Plus I told this lawyer I’m gonna share our emails at one point. I was asked to appear by zoom this morning and it was muted the entire time. 30 minutes later I get a text saying my case was dismissed. I didn’t get to hear a thing. It’s funny how sneaky the courts are. I like how my lawyer brought up transportation as his reason for the short notice. I would’ve made a special trip to make sure that warren police were held accountable before my case was dismissed. It’s also nice how the client is never included in the conversation, we hear about everything after the fact. Which is as issue for me cause judge Ginsburg said I had control over my case and could decide if my lawyer would be speaking for me and ada White knew this. Since I called my lawyers liars out loud in court when speaking about this footage and ada white was standing right there. We should’ve gone before judge Ginsburg. Enough ranting for now.

I appreciate your time and your help in getting my case dismissed. However, I’m still struggling with serious concerns regarding the way this case was handled—particularly around the evidence that was withheld and the potential misconduct involved. You mentioned that you don’t practice this aspect of law, but I hope you understand why I believe these issues still deserve your attention. Regardless of specialty, I believe any lawyer—especially one who has witnessed firsthand the consequences of procedural failures—should be invested in making sure this doesn’t happen to others. As my counsel, you’ve seen how long I fought to obtain evidence that should’ve been disclosed from the start. You’ve seen how this delayed my case, affected my mental health, and led to a baseless competency evaluation. I personally requested this evidence in January 2024. The fact that the case was dismissed only after this evidence surfaced—without it ever being shared with me—feels like a deep failure of the system. I’m not just asking this for myself, but because I believe we both know this is bigger than one person. If misconduct like this goes unaddressed, it will continue. And if lawyers don’t speak up when they see it, who will? Even if you’re not in a position to directly take action, I would deeply appreciate your help pointing me in the right direction—whether that’s by recommending someone, helping document the situation. Simply acknowledging that something went wrong won’t help prevent this from happening again. You’ve done your part in helping resolve the charge. But I’m still left with the impact of what happened, and I believe a lawyer’s role doesn’t end the moment a case is dismissed—especially when it’s dismissed under such troubling circumstances. I hope you’ll take this seriously, not just for me, but for the integrity of the legal system and the people who come after me.

But your email reflects no action taken by the District Attorney’s office against the Warren police chief or the officers involved in withholding evidence.




We both know that if a defense attorney withheld key evidence, they’d face serious consequences. How is this not a Brady disclosure violation? How is the DA’s office allowed to ignore it? As a lawyer, don’t you have an obligation to ensure the law applies equally, regardless of who is breaking it?




From the start, I told you this wasn’t a mistake—it was intentional. The facts behind my case’s dismissal should have been made part of the record, especially after everything I’ve endured, the pain this has caused me and my family. Judge Ginsburg even questioned my competency because of this nonsense—shouldn’t she have been made aware of these findings?




I requested the dash cam recordings from the Warren Police Department by email and in writing on January 10, 2024—weeks before my first competency evaluation. I never received a response. The DA’s office claimed no such videos existed. Now, after accusations of misconduct, these recordings suddenly appear, the case is dismissed, and they still refuse to turn them over? That’s not justice—that’s evidence tampering.




I still want those videos. Dismissing my case does not erase my right to evidence I legally requested.




The Commonwealth has withheld and lied about evidence before. I was naïve enough to let it go once. I won’t make that mistake again. If I ignore it, how many other innocent people will be railroaded the same way?




In 2015, I nearly took my own life after being subjected to this same legal manipulation. I’ve fought my way through it, but not everyone does. How many others have been broken by this system? When people lose faith in the law, it weakens everything we stand for.




I don’t believe any lawyer—anyone who truly cares about justice—would look at this and say nothing should be done. I know this isn’t the kind of legal system you signed up to be part of. What happens next will define whether the law still belongs to the people or only to those in power.




Also, regarding the restraining order, I may be able to use these recordings to get it lifted. 


And yes please, can you clarify which court I need to go to in order to remove the false arrest from my record? I’d appreciate it. 


Thank you for you help

Hi; so your criminal case has been nolle prossed by the commonwealth, which means it is dismissed and no longer active. Please refer to my earlier email wherein i described this process, keeping in mind that the decision to continue prosecution of a case is solely within the executive branch, (the D A), and neither the defense nor the judiciary can stop this. That's what happened this morning with your criminal case.


   In my 37 years of practice i have never lied to nor misled a client, and I'm not going to do that now. Here is what I know and what I've been told:  On Monday attorney White confirmed by text to me that no videos were available beyond booking, and the evidence would be from Beth and the two police officers. I emailed you about that. Yesterday afternoon, (while doing trial prep). I got a text from her indicating that the Warren pd just had sent her a link (that she had difficulty opening) to of all things, the dash cam videos. (Your recollection was apparently correct; makes one wonder about the bodycam.) I invited her to join in my contemplated motion to dismiss your case based on the tardy, misleading and straight-out false response from the Warren pd. I don't know just what efforts were made by prior counsel to obtain these and all other videos, but as you know we clearly moved for these to be provided, (and this was so ordered), and attorney White reported on January 8, (in good faith I believe, although I know you disagree), that no such videos existed.  I received another text from her shortly after my response about dismissal informing me that she had contacted Beth, who was not available this Friday and in all events was no longer interested in pursuing the case. Attorney White told me that the case was going to be nolle prossed. I suggested that we bring it forward from Friday so that you would not have to come in physically from Springfield just to go home again, ( i understood you to have transportation issues).


   Thar's what I know. I hope you weren't expecting to air your past grievances with the criminal justice system before a jury chosen to hear your criminal case, because as I had advised you by email previously, that wasn't going to happen. The only issue before the Worcester District Court was whether you committed an assault and battery on October 4, 2021, and that issue was resolved by the Commonwealth's decision to cease prosecution of that case. My role was to bring that charge to a successful conclusion on your behalf, and that is what happened.


Keep in mind that the Restraining Order from East Brookfield Court is still in effect. I figure you know that, but I thought I should bring it up.


   Check Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 276 Section 100C if you want to file a petition to have this case expunged from your CORI. I'm not sure whether such a petition would be filed in East Brookfield or Worcester, but I can find out if you like.


   I am at least as annoyed as you are (you probably much more) with the Warren PD for their handling of this. I don't practice this aspect of law, so I can't advise you as to what (if any) legal recourse you may have, but you are certainly free to research that.

 

  So again, I wish you the best and hope you can get this behind you quickly. I understand any lingering animosity you may have for the whole experience, but I'm glad your criminal case is finally resolved.

Follow-Up on Dashcam Footage

Dear Attorney Grady, I’m writing to follow up on our last exchange dated April 11, regarding the dashcam footage from the Warren Police Department and the sealing of my record through the East Brookfield Court. At that time, you mentioned Attorney White had contacted Warren PD and that you hoped to have a copy of the footage “next week.” Nearly a month has passed, and I have not received an update. Given the length of time this case was drawn out and the known issues around evidence being withheld, I find the continued delay troubling. As you know, the dashcam footage is not just a formality—it is a central piece of evidence that was withheld during proceedings and is part of an ongoing pattern that has legal and civil rights implications. I respectfully request a status update on: Whether the footage has been received or copiedWhen I can expect it to be delivered to meWhen I will receive the sealing form or guidance to complete that process I appreciate your continued assistance, but I also hope you understand the urgency. This matter impacts not only my legal record but the integrity of the process that brought us here. I look forward to your reply this week. Sincerely, Ricky Stebbins

i was hoping to send you both dashcam videos, but i still have just the one; i have spoken with attorney white at least three times, the last yesterday, and she reports being stymied by the warren pd evidence officer. Although the case is done, i agree you should have them, (as should I), and perhaps the freedom of information act is the way for you to go. I am going to close the file shortly (as I must after the case concludes), but I can send you the disc I have along with the form for east Brookfield; if you are able to make a copy and send a disc back to me, I would appreciate it, as I also like a complete file. I will tell attorney white that you have again inquired.

Thanks for the update. I want to be clear—I don’t need you to send me the disc. You already told me the video’s audio was poor and likely unusable. I’m not chasing a copy of something you’ve said has no real value. What I am asking for is access to the second dashcam video—evidence that we now both know exists, was court-ordered to be released, and is still being withheld. That’s not a technical delay. It’s a potential violation of Brady v. Maryland.




It should never fall on the defendant to retrieve evidence from a police department after the case has concluded. If the Warren PD evidence officer is refusing to release materials to an attorney, that’s not just my problem—it’s a systemic failure. And if it’s happening to me, it’s likely happening to others too.




Just because my case is over doesn’t mean the problem ends here. This isn’t just about me anymore. People deserve legal representation that challenges misconduct, not workarounds for it.




I’ve been using AI to help me document these failures—because someone has to. It’s helping me identify patterns that don’t make it into court records. And that includes the fact that I was left chasing evidence that should have been in my hands from the start.




Please continue pressing Attorney White. Even if this file is closing, I’m not.


Best, Ricky

I am writing to formally acknowledge receipt of your recent letter regarding the closure of my case, Commonwealth v. Stebbins (2169CR001285JT). While I understand your stated reasons for closing the file, I must express my disappointment and concern regarding the manner in which critical issues have been left unresolved.




It is factually documented that relevant dash cam footage exists and was not secured or submitted during the course of your representation. Your letter confirms that you are still awaiting a second video from Attorney White, yet you have opted to close the case despite this outstanding evidence. I must also note that I personally attempted to acquire this footage from the Warren Police Department in January 2024 and was denied access at that time.




These actions by the District Attorney’s office and related parties appear both malicious and intentional, as the withholding of evidence directly undermines the fairness of the proceedings. By choosing to ignore this behavior rather than confront it, I believe your response reflects a degree of complicity—whether through inaction or silent tolerance of misconduct.




I also want to note, for the record, that I previously informed you I would be sharing our correspondence publicly. I intend to publish the full history of our communication—along with similar issues I’ve experienced with other attorneys—as part of a documented record. This is to allow others to see the patterns of neglect, avoidance, and failure to uphold basic legal responsibilities. The public deserves to understand how often these breakdowns occur, and how frequently individuals are forced to fight for accountability on their own.




This message is not written out of emotion, but in direct response to the documented facts and the consequences of inaction. I will continue pursuing the appropriate legal and administrative channels to ensure this matter is addressed.




Sincerely,


Ricky Stebbins
