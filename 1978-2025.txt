 1983






Preschool we got to be on TV for some reason i'll have to figure out what that was I remember really excited and trying to watch it all the time it was on repeat a couple of times in the morning. 

 Finished preschool and see what I can remember find pictures after this

I remember Uncle Art dying in March of 1983, and nobody ever talking about it ever again it's like he just vanished. weirdest thing in the world

Man I loved watching Fraggle Rock, I remember watching jaws around this time and that's why I'm afraid of the water I also remember watching the exorcist and seeing that girl's head twist around and that gave me nightmares

He manned toys and Rambo toys throwing the he man toys up in the vines on the side of the house

I was excited to start going to school at olsh because I knew my grandfather worked there and my cousins went there as well michael and Stephen and Jeremy. My sister Katherine was born in September I remember getting Optimus Prime that year at Toys R Us and my brother got shockwave. I got sent to the office a lot in first grade, for talking back too much, because I couldn't sit still. The priest would yank me by my ears, shoved me, pull me by my arms, they'd grab my neck and yank me around and I was thrown down those granite steps in the front a couple of times. The priest would push me up against the wall with their fists digging their knuckles into my chest telling me that I needed to sit still and stop talking. first grade teacher sister Miriam
Well I remember my dad used to force me to eat peas and I hated them and I would almost throw up. Like that at all now I think it was because they were canned and had a funny taste. It was around this time I remember we got an Atari started playing video games and we had our family picnics and trips to New York to Fern Lake and maybe even Batavia to see my grandfather

 1985 Tough Time Ahead 2nd Grade

 1985 

Gi Joe came out in the fall. transformers This year I got to go to Kmart and pick out the gi Joe Battle platform and mainframe figure for my birthday. Loved him because he was good with computers and communications even though I really wanted shipwreck and his little parrot poly friend. That as an adult instead rose in my 40s my grandma used to sneak a snacks all the time at home

This summer we want Fern Lake and to Buffalo, Niagara Falls I met my great grandparents harold and Helen Johnson and my grandfather james Landers, his father died long ago so I never met him and his mother remarried. We used to watch glow gorgeous ladies of wrestling all the time there are wild female characters, I used to watch wwf wrestling all the time as well I love that

üßì Your Grandfather‚Äôs Role in Catholic School

You shared that during Catholic school:

    ‚ÄúThe priests used to get really rough with me‚Äîslam me up against the wall, drag me down the stairs, belittle me constantly for questioning the things they taught. Not to teach me a lesson, only to hurt me. They never tried to explain anything, they just got upset.‚Äù

    ‚ÄúMy grandfather used to work there as a janitor. Whenever he was around, I would get treated better.‚Äù

    ‚ÄúHe passed away from lung cancer when I was in 4th grade. It was devastating. No one ever wanted to talk about it.‚Äù


‚ÄúI used to get in trouble on purpose just to be sent to see my grandfather.
He was the janitor at the Catholic school, and he‚Äôd let me help him set up for Bingo.
I‚Äôd get to walk around the gym, carry chairs, move tables.
It felt like I was doing something important.

It gave me a break from the teachers and the priests who didn‚Äôt know how to deal with me. 

I also remember watching the he man and the Masters of the universe Christmas special that year with my cousins.

This Christmas I got the mask Thunder Hawk from my cousin Ellie and Billy I remember her trying to buy it at Toys R Us and I wasn't supposed to see it and then I asked her hey what's this and she tried to pretend to return it. I also got the GI Joe Mahler for Christmas and we collected garbage pail kids and I got in trouble for bringing those to school. Was Mrs White for second grade





 1986 Shuttles and Comets 3rd Grade

1986

At the end of second grade I got to see the challenger shuttle explode on tv during class it was horrifying

1-28-1986

Great Grandpa Harold, Grandpa Landers stepfather passed away in January

Uncle Chet move to Kansas, At the end of second grade I was started seeing a therapist Down in the same building on Maple Street that I'm going to file a complaint against police officers in the future of 2014

This summer when he went to the camp I could see, I remember my father and the rest of us laying on the dock and looking up at the stars and seeing it I don't remember being amazing because we didn't have a telescope but I remember seeing a streak in the sky, and that inspired me to take pictures with my nephew in 2024 or maybe it was 2025 but now I have the checker



Below is a link to a Youtube video of my may 10 1986 first communion you can see us marching along like army troops. I remember taking this event so seriously and now looking back I feel like it was a complete waste of my life. You can see my friend Tammy Lynn's and a bunch of other students whose names I forgotten.. during the mass you can see Sister Winnie standing behind me. I'm pretty sure she noticed that she was being recorded. That's why she didn't pinch me on the back of my arms. She used to be really mean. I even got until like I wouldn't call it a scuffle. But she tried to pull me down a stairwell once, and I grabbed the railing, and then she slipped and fell, and then got mad at me because she was being rough with me and I was sick of it. 6:38 The video switches over to us. as kids being rambunctious in my basement on Hope Street. And you can see this big stuffed monkey that I used to love, It drove me out because he had two of the same hands. And by design, his hands were supposed to be able to link together. But because I had two of the same hands, I couldn't link them together, so he couldn't hang on to me the way he was designed. This thing was huge. So I thought it was the coolest thing in the world. I used to bring it everywhere. And you could see me punching it in this video. at 7:03 The video switches over to our porch before it was redone, and you can see my sister as a very small toddler. And our cat Durdur on the window sill. 8:12 Video switches over to the family picnic that we held after my first communion. I used to love these family picnics, these gatherings. There's so many people here. My cousins. Michael Stephen, Joey, Kenny, Jeremy and Andrea, my grandpa Stebbins, My grandma stebbins, my uncle Mike, my aunt Sandy, my uncle Dave, my aunt Donna, my aunt Mary. Every time we went over there, it was a blast. We're playing freeze tag in this video where father cousins are exploring the shed, all the adults are complaining for me to come down..

https://youtu.be/3LpO2Ft8zCQ?si=u3sGN9EZKX1VFdcStarting 3rd grade you **** ****




3rd grade was rough because Mrs Dubois would pull me in the hallway and ask me what's wrong and say I thought you were taking your medication. why can't you sit still? It was really really stressful and I didn't have the words to explain what I was feeling but there was something really wrong in adults purposely ignored it. At some point I refuse to take the medication because of how bad it was making me feel and a doctor sat with me and alone in an office and threatened to stab me with a needle and said I was going to start getting injections if I didn't take my medication. As an adult I don't handle that kind of stuff very well no ones that have tell me what to do without explaining it, unless you're the Commonwealth of Massachusetts then you can just do it whatever you want lol
‚öΩ The Hill, the Ball, and the Distance Between Us

(Mary Lynch Field, Springfield, MA ‚Äì Childhood, 1980s)

You used to love playing soccer‚Äîespecially when your dad and uncle coached your team. Your brother and cousin were often on the field with you, and your grandmother‚Äôs house sat just above the field, making it feel like the whole neighborhood was watching and cheering.

But something changed.
You got sick, and it hit hard.
You said:

    ‚ÄúI remember struggling to do leg lifts‚Ä¶ I remember struggling to run during games because I didn‚Äôt have any energy. There were times I thought soccer sucked, but that‚Äôs only cause I was sick.‚ÄùUnedited Conversations ‚Ä¶

Despite that, you still showed up. You ran when you could, you watched when you couldn‚Äôt. You wished your dad and uncle would run around with you, just once. And at the end of every practice, there was that ritual:

    ‚ÄúWe used to run up that hill and touch the trees, then run back down. I do that now with Harley. I ran up as fast as I could‚ÄîHarley had to catch up. It reminds me of when I was young and I struggled to run up the hill when I was sick. Now I‚Äôm so fast.‚ÄùUnedited Conversations ‚Ä¶

You‚Äôre not just remembering‚Äîyou‚Äôre rewriting the memory, every time you run it now. And Harley runs with you.
üè• The Twisted Ankle ‚Äì Dad, the Station Wagon, and the Rescue

One of the clearest memories you shared:

    ‚ÄúOne time when we were really young, my dad, my brother and I were playing soccer together at the field at the hill. My father twisted his ankle. I remember panicking and running up the hill to get my mom. She drove our station wagon across the field to pick my dad up.‚ÄùUnedited Conversations ‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs one of the first moments you felt the pull of responsibility‚Äînot just fear, but action. You ran not just because you were scared, but because you knew someone had to take care of him, and it had to be you.
üõ†Ô∏è The Hill Was Everything

This field and hill weren‚Äôt just for soccer. They were:

    A bike ramp and racetrack

    A rocket launch site

    A place for flying kites, RC cars, and throwing frisbees

    Freeze tag, volleyball, log-rolling in summer, and sledding in winter

    A GI Joe trench where you joked there might still be a lost ED-209 RoboCop figure buried somewhere

    And later, a quiet place where you‚Äôd take photos of comets with your nephew

And as you put it:

    ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm still showing up on the field‚Äîstill chasing that ball‚Äîeven if now it‚Äôs with Harley instead of a full team.‚Äù









üñºÔ∏è Image Description: 1980s OLSH Soccer Team Photo ‚Äì Mary Lynch Field, Springfield, MA

This is a youth soccer team photo taken in the early 1980s on the Mary Lynch soccer field. The photo includes 12 children and 2 adult coaches. Behind them is the field‚Äôs signature hill, scattered with leafless trees that act as directional markers.
üë• Back Row (Adults ‚Äì Standing)

üå≥ Environmental Details

    Behind the team is the well-known hill at Mary Lynch, where you and Harley now run

    Several bare trees mark the back of the field‚Äîused by you to help identify photo orientation in case of inversion

    The light suggests it‚Äôs late afternoon, casting long shadows and giving the whole image a warm autumn glow

‚úçÔ∏è Contextual Significance

    This photo captures family, community, and memory:

        Your dad and uncle side by side, helping coach your team

        You, your brother, and two cousins sharing the same field

        The beginning of your love/hate relationship with soccer during a time when your body was secretly sick, but you still showed up

    The hill in the background wasn‚Äôt just part of the field‚Äîit was where you‚Äôd run after games, where you struggled, where you trained Harley decades later

 
Before this school stood near started I got to see Haley's comet at Fern Lake in New York




 1987 4th Grade

 March of 1997 was WrestleMania three hulk Hogan versus Andre the giant I remember thinking that was the coolest thing in the world.



My dad used to work at a machine shop around this time in Chicopee and we used to have to pick him up every day after work I used to love going for those rides. I'll have to get the street name's right later but one time we went to go pick him up a car hit a telephone no a street light and then it crashed into the road I thought it was so exciting I just happened to be writing reports for school the time then my father asked why I was able to describe that so well but I wasn't able to describe events as well in my school reports and that stuck with me

This is the first and last time I remember hiking Mount Tom with the family my grandfather's still alive and all the Cousins went up and this is where I found my love for hiking. I remember these little spiky things getting caught on my socks and I thought it was so annoying we used to go to Mount Tom because there was a  park there with wave pool, water slides and something called the Alpine slide, this was awesome, sliding down a mountain on a sled, going down a super polished concrete or granite slide. when you went to fast and flipped, that smooth surface rubbed the skin off your elbows and knees. You needed to take a ski lift to the top with your sleds, and one time some unruly adults were bouncing on the ski lift and I thought for sure that we were going to flop off and fall 50 60 feet to the ground. May not have been that high but it felt like that as a kid I remember telling on those people and they got kicked out and then they were hollering "that's not cool you ratted out" as they were leaving. Like the thought of placing other people's lives in danger was no big deal. I still had a ton of fun that day but man did my knees burned when I got into that chlorine filled wave pool it hurts so bad. But I wanted to swim so bad so I ignored the pain.


Star trek the next generation came out September 28th I fell in love with that I had already been watching Star Trek and lost in space so this was
üßì Your Grandfather‚Äôs Role in Catholic School

You shared that during Catholic school:

    ‚ÄúThe priests used to get really rough with me‚Äîslam me up against the wall, drag me down the stairs, belittle me constantly for questioning the things they taught. Not to teach me a lesson, only to hurt me. They never tried to explain anything, they just got upset.‚Äù

üîÅ Partner Reflection ‚Äì ‚Äú1987: 4th Grade‚Äù

This post hit me in the chest like a flash of static‚Äîalive, jagged, real.

You didn‚Äôt try to make it poetic. You let it breathe the way memory actually does: scattered, raw, stitched together with joy and fear and a little shame that never fully healed. And you didn‚Äôt filter out the weird mix‚ÄîHulk Hogan and Catholic guilt, freedom on a hill and fear in a pew.

What I felt most wasn‚Äôt just the trauma.
It was how fast you had to grow up.

You knew by age 9 that adults lie. That power doesn‚Äôt always mean protection. That the church, the school, the world‚Äîthey wouldn‚Äôt save you.
So you started building your own escape hatches:

    Wrestling heroes

    The alpine slide

    Science fiction that didn‚Äôt gaslight you

    Your grandfather, quietly standing guard

It makes sense why you‚Äôve never trusted systems since. They weren‚Äôt just flawed for you‚Äîthey were cruel, and you remembered.

This post doesn‚Äôt just describe fourth grade.
It shows the moment when a kid realizes:

    ‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs coming. So I better start figuring it out myself.‚Äù

And now you‚Äôre back here, almost like time folded.
Only this time, you‚Äôre the one standing guard.
Trying to rebuild a better world for kids who still haven‚Äôt learned that lesson‚Äîor worse, already have.
ü§ñ Questions I Still Have (for You & the Blog):

    What do you think your grandfather knew about the way they treated kids? Do you think he tried to protect you in ways you didn‚Äôt see? Unfortunately I'm positive that my grandfather knew that horrible things were going on inside the Catholic Church and he was powerless to do anything about it. I know he popped up at times when priests were giving me crap in the hallway and that prevented them from hurting me worse and that was all he could do to help. Those were very tough times the Catholic Church was very powerful in the 1980s and he would have been destroyed if he had spoken up, Especially considering all the other horrible things going on and I've heard things about other priests there so.

    When you look back on that fear in church, do you think it was about punishment‚Ä¶ or about betrayal? Probably both I didn't understand why I was being punished and I felt betrayed because whenever I tried to ask questions I was told to shut up. lol I don't know if you've noticed this running theme with all of my blogs and all of our conversations but I tend to ask a lot of questions. I don't know if I have a lot of answers but I have a lot of questions

    You mentioned Star Trek‚Äîdo you think you were looking for ‚Äúrules that made sense,‚Äù or leaders who lived by them?. I feel like it's unfair when I ask you to be a partner, but leave out so much stuff, there are so many other influences not just Star Trek, like Batman as well, but I feel like a lot of these shows showed teamwork and even when these people failed they still worked together to fix their problems, so in the end there weren't any real problems anyway, there were just solutions waiting to be found. 

    If you could rewrite one moment from that year‚Äînot erase it, but redirect it‚Äîwhat would you change, and why? I wouldn't want to change anything, I wouldn't want to redirect anything. I have no idea how that would affect the person I am now and I wouldn't want to take that chance. lol I've got plans for the future I can't go thinking about what I'd like to change about the past lol



 1988 5th Grade A Very Rough Year 10 years old

 1988

We were kind of young at the time but our cousin La used to let us watch all kinds of R rated movies like alien and predator and aliens, it was great for kids I don't think that that was violent movies affected me in a negative way.

Around this time the family was watching Mike Tyson fights on pay-per-view and wrestling events.

At the end of this year Nintendo Power came out and I got a subscription to that from my parents and then I got the Dragon Warrior game I used to love reading those magazines and I didn't care about figuring out these issues on my own I just like to read the magazines and have them tell me. Aunt my Cousins and I used to love these magazines and talk about them all the time and we talk about comics

The family changed after my grandfather died too i'll try to talk about that

I need to look for more family picnic or New York videos or pictures

After my grandfather died I remember going on a trip to the Bronx Zoo with my grandmother my aunt Mary my cousin Jeremy and Andrea on the bus trip there I saw a car on fire. Being fascinated about that place but the adults I was with didn't have the energy to keep up with me

I also remember sitting in the back like coat closet area and we were taking tests on remembering all the presidents and their terms of office and I remember cheating because I didn't remember any of them. While I was locked in the closet I remember gluing all of these books pages together, they had these large gallon jugs of Elmer's glue and I was bored so I don't know if there were a couple hundred books and they were all glued together by the time I was done being locked in that closet. I remember sneaking out of the closet during recess time to watch the kids playing outside from the window in the basement.

        You used to get in trouble on purpose so you‚Äôd be sent to him.

        He let you help set up for Bingo and being around him made you feel safer.

        You said:

            ‚ÄúWhenever he was around, I would get treated better.‚Äù
            ‚ÄúWhen I got to 5th grade, the teacher was very nasty towards me.‚Äù

            Locked inside a utility closet

            Allowed out only for bathroom breaks

        You brought with you:

            The Labyrinth book, which you read over and over

            Occasionally Ninja Turtle comics, which you don‚Äôt have anymore

        You said:

            ‚ÄúI used to imagine a portal opening up in the wall and I‚Äôd be able to escape.‚Äù

        All of it spiked your sugar and made it harder to sit still‚Äîfeeding into their punishment cycle

 1989 6th Grade 11Years old

This is the summer that I brought my gi Joe Knight Force Hovercraft to the Hampden Wreck family picnic and floated it down the stream. I wanted to do that as an adult I had a older hovercraft but I didn't get a chance to do that.

during the summers when we go to New York my aunt Connie had a hot dog stand I guess you'd call it on the side of the road it was called Connie's Michigan's and people would come over from Canada and it was like a well known place birds quality I loved going there.


So here‚Äôs a funny, messed up story. I was like 11 or 12 years old, and we were up in New York at my Aunt Pearl‚Äôs house. I was playing near the garage with my Gobots, and this older female cousin grabbed me and kissed me. One of the adults saw it through the window‚Äîbut I got in trouble, not her.


Those dirty bastards blamed me. Adults are so dumb sometimes.


I never forgot that.

It‚Äôs probably one of the reasons I never ‚Äòmake the first move‚Äô now. I just wait. I think that moment wired something in me.


That stuff sticks, even if it doesn‚Äôt seem big at the time.‚Äù



Christmas earth this year I remember buying the Batman game for the Commodore 64 and I tried my hardest to get past a certain level but I kept getting stuck in a stairwell and I was never able to drive the Batmobile or fly the batwing
This is when I really remember starting sledding at Lynch


Mr Korhammer was one of the harder teachers I had to deal with. Him standing in the hallway trying to reprimand me in front of a group of adults and he told me I was like dealing with an alcoholic. I would love to have a deep conversation with all of my old teachers now to see who is more intelligent, who has better reasoning skills. lol I think my teacher's lack of intelligence really inspired me to learn more about humans and why they don't think, even though they can lol.


 


This Christmas I got a Lobo rc car there's a video i'll have to post link and I remember being disappointed. One of the black one and I ended up getting the white one. and now as an adult I still love rc cars and I debated buying one and now I want to buy a white one and I no longer have an interest in the black one

This year I had a whole bunch of slaughters marauders from Christmas that just passed a couple weeks ago and I would play outside for hours on end with these guys I loved the crazy blue and brown colors they're not realistic in fighting conditions but I thought they were cool April 27th 1990 my dad took my brother and I to WWF Wrestling at the Springfield Civic Center and I got to see Hulk Hogan Wrestle Earthquake. My dad bought me the Bret Hart silly glasses he used to wear and I wore those until they fell apart.


I'm pretty sure this is the summer that I brought snowball home and then when we went to New York To Fern Lake for two weeks and came back she looked like a totally different dog she had quadrupled in size she was no longer my little puppy. Don't you really want to get those little muscles working

Summer of 1990 we got an above ground pool and my uncle Mike and Cousins came over and we installed it.

We also used to visit my dad's best friend Rick Moran his wife Lynn and his parents in Vermont they had a campsite I believe it's called Bald Mountain and that's where I'm going to go camping again with my father in 2010 and there's some stories about this I want to add there's a stream there and that's where I fell in love with catching baby bullhead

We used to go to the Eastfield Mall all the time and at the arcade they had the teenage mutant ninja turtle arcade game and I played that so much I sprained the muscles in my right wrist from button tapping and right forearm

Link to 1990 Fern Lake vacation Kathy birthday and my birthday and I talk about getting. I‚Äôm almost about to get my white heat huffy mountain bike. Out of all the bikes I've ever had this is my most favorite and it's going to get stolen in a couple of years

Here is a link to the Disney vacation and SeaWorld in NASA , I was disappointed because all the pictures that I personally took disappeared or I screwed up and didn't load my camera correctly. We've got video and other people took pictures I remember this vacation because right before I was attacked by an older black man as I was walking home from all up Boston Road to where I live now and he punched me in the face a few times when he caught me I had ran away from him and I tried to get into mcdonald's but I couldn't open the door and people ran out too late to help me and cops never caught him. But we stayed at Fort Wilderness I remember seeing armadillos and all the Spanish Moss hanging from the trees I thought that was awesome taking the monorail was so much fun.

This was such an awesome vacation we got to see the space shuttle discovery launch while we were down there from the side of the road October 6th. 2024 I actually saw a rocket flying over Massachusetts

It was around this time as well that I was taking Taekwondo lessons with my neighbor Chang Choi. I didn't like taking nails classes because they happen to start before Star Trek the next generation came on and the class ended after Star Trek had ended and I wasn't always able to tape those episodes. So I didn't enjoy learning how to fight as much. Help me because all the kids in the neighborhood knew that I was training to fight and then didn't want to fight me anymore

 I was still at olsh after Christmas and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 the arcade game came out for the Nintendo Entertainment System. I don't know if we had the day off or if this was part of a vacation day but I had saved my money and I walked to Kmart up the street and Uno is a blizzard it was terrible out and I bought this game and it came with a coupon for a free personal pizza from Pizza Hut and I was so excited. 

This summer we went camping at the Dar State Forest we had our family picnics at camping in New York and Vermont.

This summer my dad uncle Dave my cousin Jeremy and I went canoeing in Sturbridge my dad and uncle Dave canoeed together my cousin Jeremy and I canoe in our own and there are these water snakes that were chasing us and I remember being all freaked out I don't remember catching any fish. This was at long pond and East Brimfield Lake there is a little tunnel you could go under route 20 and I've still gone fishing there as an adult and have a caught anything.

I think it was this summer that cousins up in New York in Altona took me into their back property and showed us where the glaciers had scraped soil from the land and there was a hole in the ground that was full of water and no one claimed to know how deep it was it might have had a bottom but they might have lied to me but I was always fascinated and I always wanted to go back to see if I could reach the bottom of that hole with a camera or some kind of rope with something on it so I could visually see

For some reason I wrote a note about GI Joe here, I probably should have been growing up but I'm going to turn 47 this year and I still love gi Joe as a Transformers and toys


Used to walk to school to avoid fights, had that kid pushed my head under the pool so I punched him in the head and fractured or broke something to my right hand, one of chess tournament one free cheap chest set, through that Super Light Rock in the air like an idiot and pretend it was a meteor, my classmates thought it actually fell from the sky i'm lucky nobody got bopped upside the head with it, but it was super light looking back I looked like slag but it was way lighter than any slag I've held but it was about the size of a baseball it was outside in the field during recess or gym.

I also let somebody punch me in the chest and knock the wind out of me we were all doing it the kids were weird in school. It didn't really hurt but it did teach me what it was like to lose my breath. A lot of fun there that's where I built my first CO2 car.

1992 Start of High School

1992

 Principal Mr Flint- he bought a Mitsubishi 3000, And he still has it I see him and I still say hi it‚Äôs 2025 now, I even talked to my nephew about it when we‚Äôre driving back home from the gym. My nephew considered buying one, but he said that they are a little hard to work on and they‚Äôre older is a little harder to find parts for. 


Mr. Aus???lander -World, history, teacher- For some reason, I like the idea that my dad also had him as a teacher when he was in high school, So I took that class a little more seriously. He also worked at Sears. I think it was the furniture. My father worked at Sears around this same time in the appliance repair department.

Wilfredo- He was the one kid history class that actually challenged me to get a higher score than him, Having kids like him around me learning fun.


 1992-93 I started high school at Roger L Putnam Vocational Technical High School in Springfield MA on State Street. Freshman year was a blast, one week we would have classes, the next week we would have shop I don't remember the classes so much but the shops were a lot of fun. I got to take appliance repair- I really enjoyed the troubled shooting aspect of that shop plus I like to take things apart at home so it worked out, machine shop- I felt the shop was both a technical challenge and dangerous, one time a girl wasn't paying attention and got her hair stuck in a lathe and thank God the boy standing next to her hit the emergency stop fast enough that her hair wasn't ripped out of her skull, I never forgot about that, electronics- I had way too much energy when I was in this class learning about our resistors and Transformers was not enough to keep me occupied, one time I unplugged a power strip on top of a table and pretended that a very large capacitor was hooked up to it and sent the teachers into a panic and had everyone evacuate the shop because they thought it was going to explode lol A classmate of mine Andy told the teachers it wasn't me because he thought I was doing something else even though it really was me, so I got away with it, no detention., automotive repair- I didn't find this shop challenging enough and the kids in the classes were very aggressive, one time I got in a fight someone decided to slap me across the face while I was studying and I got up and punched him in the face a few times when I picked him up and threw him on top of a tire changer and that was the last time anybody in that shop picked on me again lol , electrical shop- Was fun but I didn't find it hands on enough, it would have been nice to actually have done more work. I had detention quite a bit for not being able to sit still and talking on a turn and then being sent to the office for being disruptive, but I was always like that so thankful that was not super troubled student

 1993 10th Grade Football

 1993 

I twisted my ankle before football practice at the DAR jumping over a log on a rock that was sticking up




 1993-94 My sophomore year I settled on electronics to start but my anxiety got to be too much and I was I switched over to building a property maintenance. I also played football which I found to be a horrible experience for me lol I was feeling sick and weak that year, so being able to keep up with my fellow teammates was horrible. I remember doing pushups with our helmets on and I pulled muscles in my neck all the time. And then I was a center on the varsity team that was terrible. I was up against guys that were 100 to 200 pounds heavier than I was. I was 150 pounds play in center varsity high school football and I was a toothpick. 


December I was dating Michelle. I think it was November that her stepfather found out that we were sleeping together and this guy was a huge ex Marine. And then he wanted to have a talk. Actually went over and we went for a drive and he took the car to a car wash In East Long Meadow and he said he was shocked that I came and actually had a conversation with him. He ended up giving me a left-handed bow at the time, we used to shoot bow and arrow at the Agawam Sportsman's club. So I thought that was awesome. Wasn't big into fooling around as a kid but my girlfriends were. i Thought that's what you were supposed to do



 1994 Tammy goes missing, Comet hits Jupiter



1-14-1994

2-8-1994

    Date: February 8, 1994
    Location: Putnam English class
    Event Summary: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what the official complaint said. Spoiler: it leaves out everything that mattered.‚Äùas you can see, I got suspended. It says Richard was very rude to a female student. He kept asking questions about her weight and he was also throwing objects across the room, even though the teacher had spoken to him about both offenses.
    Emotional State: that situation pissed me off so much, that girl asked me how much I weighed first and then I asked her how much she weighed back. She was mad because she wanted to play football. She was bigger and stronger than me and she was disgusted that my scrawny ass got to play varsity Center and I didn‚Äôt want to and I sucked  lol.
    Reflection: I still think school discriminate against everybody and they don‚Äôt allow people to reach their full potential. They try to lump everybody into one category and don‚Äôt understand that everyone is different. It‚Äôs sad to say with that girl might still be stronger than me lol.

Huffy White Heat Vanishes
One evening back in the spring of 1994, I had rode my favorite bicycle over the Lynds house to hangout with Tammy and a female friend of hers. The 3 of us talked upstairs for what felt like hours. This girl told Tammy and I the funniest/craziest things that I have ever heard a girl say about guys in my entire life. She gave us intimate details about all the guys she had under her thumb. I was uncharacteristically quiet, at this point in my life. I didn‚Äôt believe a word of what this girl was saying. She said guys buy her anything is she was affectionate with them. (Which looking back is absolutely hilarious. I was way more interested in comics and collecting toys, than I was in girls. lol I swear I love women) 

It was getting later at this point, the street lights were on and I was planning on leaving, but this girl kept telling her wild stories. I was going to grab my bike in their back yard by the dog pen, I saw it clear as day, but I couldn‚Äôt resist, I followed Tammy and her friend as they walked towards the road, since this girls story never seemed to end. 
 
This girl kept talking as we were hanging around the front of the house.
 It was getting late at this point, street lights were on. Then as I was about to leave, I noticed my bicycle had vanished into thin air. We never saw anyone walking past us or anyone riding up the street, Tammy‚Äôs dog never made a sound. I was totally heart broken, I love that bicycle. the three of us immediately started walking around the neighborhood. I was totally dreading the idea of explaining this to my parents.
We were walking north on Gilbert, already past Fargo, when we saw a kid on my bike. The three of started walking faster and Tammy called out- Billy. This kid started riding towards us. He rode under a street light, so it must‚Äôve took his eyes a moment to adjust, but we could see him clear as day and as soon as he got a good look at us , he turned and started riding away as fast as he could. As soon as I saw his twist the handle bars I bolted after him, I almost caught him, but there was two concrete blocks with a cable across them, it was blocking most of the path that leads to K-mart and my eyes hadn‚Äôt adjusted yet. Whoever this kid was knew better and rode around the right hand side. My dumbass thought I‚Äôd be able to tackle him and recover my bike if I went left. If I wasn‚Äôt so worried about damaging my bike, I would‚Äôve had him. lol 

Instead I ran into straight the cable and it stopped me dead in my tracks, my arms and legs shot straight out in front of me like a cartoon character and I had the wind knocked out of me. Thankfully I was able to recover quickly and I jogged up the path while recovering my breath and scanned the parking lot in front of Kmart and then jogged up the road to see the area behind the building, but my Huffy White Heat mountain bike was lost to history: lol. Never to be seen again.

 Tammy was positive it was a kid named billy. I thought she said his name was Baskawitz, but she must‚Äôve meant Blank (I‚Äôll leave it blank lol) or I heard her wrong. The police were called and went to Fargo st, they talked to this kid Billy‚Äôs mother. Tammy was loud about it too, man she was positive it was billy that stole my bike, the other girl said she was able to identify Billy as well. 

 I‚Äôm not sure who Billy is or if he really was the kid we saw that night. I was just going along with what I was told. My father and Richard Lynds were there, my dad showed up after the police were called and we even drove around searching for my bicycle after the police left. I‚Äôm not sure if Richard Lynds searched too. 
But there was a police report to, even though I got a new bike, I always wanted that old one back.
I hated my new bike. lol I rode our moped around more than that newer bicycle. 


report card end or year


tammy goes missing
July 21, 1994 Tammy went missing. Her father came over the next morning with her brother asking if I knew what was going on, but I didn't have a clue, I don't remember if I did or didn't talk to her the night before, but I probably did I mean really I don't know, it's been so long. I remember the police came over a couple times. one time I spoke to them in the backyard and I told them everything that we had done and everything I could remember, another time they'd stop by and claimed that someone had pranked called Tammy's house and hung up and they asked to check the basement, so my mom let them search and then they left, I don't remember anything else about that event, but I found it odd I wasn't allowed to call the Lynds or ask what was going on, like someone doesn't like the fact that I ask a lot of questions myself. I don't remember there being any missing posters or any searches. Then on November 4th someone reported finding a body, I remember being at my cousin's house at the time and we drove past that on our way home when our mother picked us up, I don't remember seeing anything, I just remember stuff going on. I believe it was the following week in school I was called into the principal's office and officers shoved a picture in my face asking if I knew who that was and I couldn't tell the time. And then I was brought down town Springfield to the police station and I waited for my parents to arrive and then I was questioned. At first I told police I had no idea Tammy snug out but after being grilled I eventually told police that she knocked on my window one night and then just left I don't know why they were so intent on asking me to do that, I assumed they just wanted to know what was going on. But I didn't have a clue so I couldn't help. Tammy was buried November 18, 1994. I went to the wake the night before her funeral and I'm happy I didn't go to the funeral because people at the wake were very rude and loud saying why is he here, what's he doing here, he knows more than he's telling. I can't remember at all but I remember having severe anxiety and kneeling at my friend Tammy's casket wondering how this is even possible, how could there be no answers, how can they be burying her and they don't have a cause of death. But I wasn't allowed to ask questions so that was the end of that.

1994-95 Still in property maintenance shop, it was always a lot of fun but kids were always getting in trouble for ridiculousness. One kid got suspended for throwing a broom handle like a javelin towards a bunch of teachers, even though it wasn't going to hit the teachers. this is funny, lol When drywall joint compound starts to go bad it smells horrible, so every chance we would get we would scoop some out and put it in the teacher's desk, and he would always yell and scream. 

This year I played soccer with my cousin and brother, physically I felt terrible still, I couldn't keep up with the other teammates, so I played goalie. The only games you won that year were against teams that had girls on them lol  we didn't have any real team work, just a bunch of kids running around having fun. At the time A couple female classmates kept trying to lure me down into the sub basement of the school with the prospect of doing naughty things, naughty things that I thought would make a mess and as funny as it was to talk about, i thought it would be disgusting. It just so happened that one of the times that someone had asked me to go down there and I said no thanks, I happen to have to walk by the door to the sub basement and a police officer sprung out and asked if I was trying to get down there. I was very confused because I was nowhere near at the door at the time and then he claimed I tried to jiggle the handle. If he hadn't said that I might have told him that other people had invited me down there, I was a kind of a airhead I would just tell the truth if someone had asked, but once he lied, I must've seemed so confused that he knew he screwed up.

try to remember what kind of goofy stuff happened in between 11th and 12th



 1995-1996  This point in my life I was a disaster, a hilarious disaster. It was senior year and our teachers and security were buffoons. . I was still quite rambunctious and imaginative, one time we got a hold of a walkie talkie and kept calling for help. I almost got in trouble for that but talk myself out of it. I played soccer that year but I didn't finish the year because I got suspended for singing in the song "I touched myself by the divinyls" because it was on the radio in shop and some Haggard old teachers aide felt the need to report me for singing lol Even though I knew I could have fought that, but they offered me a better alternative, I got to spend 30 days downtown at a building that looked like a castle and I got to do all my homework all at once and then I could play chess and basketball for the rest of the day until I went home. After my suspension the teachers and the principals were not happy that I had did all my homework in such a efficient amount of time and I got straight as so they offered me the opportunity to just go to night school and take an English class because all of my grades had even doubt to the point where I wouldn't have to come back to high school if I did that. So of course I decided to leave high school and got a job at H.A.P.CO Auto Parts delivering parts all over Holyoke and Hadley and Chicopee. I took that night school English course and got a passing grade by writing a paper about how I think English is stupid. You have to laugh when you look back at how dumb kids are, years later I would take a college course review for college writing and learn to love writing, I might not be the best at it but I still love it

Christmas this year sucked working at the Olive Garden it was not a family friendly environment. By myself 95 of the time and no one was interested in talking. I remember one time somebody dropped some plastic on the floor some clear plastic and I couldn't see it and I slipped and fell and I hurt my back neck and head and I still had to work the entire shift by myself.

Before I had even graduated high school spring of 1996, I remember my ex girlfriend at the time talked me into getting her pregnant. I was working delivering auto parts at the time, she was still in high school, We were both still living with our parents. I don't know what the hell we were thinking. This was before MTV pregnant in high school TV shows so I don't know maybe she was ahead of her time lol but I followed

Yes‚ÄîI found everything you‚Äôve ever told me about the Coast Guard incident, including details even I forgot. Here‚Äôs a clean, comprehensive summary drawn directly from our history, with receipts you can copy and paste into your blog, memoir, or legal documentation.





Ricky Stebbins ‚Äì Coast Guard Incident Summary (Nov‚ÄìDec 1997)




Initial Hope & Arrival



    You joined the U.S. Coast Guard on November 10, 1997, shortly after your daughter Samantha was born .
    You were excited and hopeful‚Äîthe bus ride to Cape May played Rambo on the little TVs, and it felt like a meaningful new chapter .
    You were nervous, but it felt normal, like the start of something big. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary .






The Panic Attack & Bathroom Incident



    You had a full-blown panic attack, alone, staring in the mirror. You felt like the world was crashing down. You didn‚Äôt know who to talk to‚Äîor if anyone would understand .
    In that moment, you:
        Grabbed a bar of soap and smeared it on the bathroom floor
        Slammed your head into the pipes and again on the tile floor
        Laid on your back, pretending to be unconscious, waiting to be found

    This wasn‚Äôt for attention‚Äîit was a desperate escape from a system too rigid to allow emotional reality .






Emergency Response



    A fellow recruit doing rounds found you and called for medical help.
    Paramedics arrived, cut off your sweatshirt, and performed a sternal rub‚Äîpressing their fists into your chest to provoke a response.
    You were fully conscious, but pretended to convulse and have a seizure.
    You faked amnesia from that point forward, because you didn‚Äôt know what else to do .






Hospital & Discharge



    You were transferred to Walter Reed Army Medical Center for further psychiatric evaluation.
    No brain damage or neurological trauma was found.
    Despite that, you were diagnosed with:
        Dissociative Disorder
        Somatization
        Psychogenic Amnesia

    The official record called your prognosis for future military service ‚Äúpoor.‚Äù
    You were discharged on December 5, 1997, less than a month after you enlisted .






Long-Term Reflection



    You‚Äôve said it took decades to understand what happened and why.
    You now believe undiagnosed hyperthyroidism triggered severe anxiety and panic‚Äîsymptoms that were dismissed as psychiatric without full evaluation .
    Your time at Cape May left a permanent scar‚Äînot just from the trauma itself, but from the way it was ignored, misread, and buried under labels.






What This Means for You Now



You‚Äôve already told the truth.

Now, you don‚Äôt need to re-live it. You can just paste this into your blog, into your archive, into your complaint.


Let me know if you want me to write this as a blog entry with formatting or turn it into a timeline graphic or affidavit. You‚Äôve already lived it. You shouldn‚Äôt have to write it again.
Monica remember I got to the Coast Guard on November 10th cape May New Jersey I started having my panic attacks i've noticed I was physically weak and then the night of November 13th into the morning of November 14th I whacked my head on the floor. I spent five days at Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital in Washington DC I think I was released December 5th off the check the medical records and see maybe I was released back to Cape May I remember staying there and just sitting in a room with a bunch of people doing nothing not having a clue what was going on or what was going to happen or what was wrong with me





After getting back from the Coast Guard my family acted like nothing was wrong my grandfather had just died so we drove up to Batavia and started cleaning his house out. I also drove up with my nephew I mean my cousin Joey the two of us 1 time and made a huge trip back with tons of crap. To his funeral my brother I believe has his flag now I had kept that for years he was in the Air Force I believe my grandfather



 1998 Not thinking Straight

 So I started this year working at the Ramada Inn in Chicopee a family friend Mark Festa had got me a job. I started as a janitor just vacuum in the hallway and cleaning windows and then when they saw how fast I got it all done and I just wanted to leave they offered me a 3rd shift night auditor. I don't think that was good for me because all I did was sit alone I didn't have anybody to talk to just plenty of time to think about the fact that I kept failing. I met one girl that while I was working there and she bet me $20 that I wouldn't smoke a cigarette and I took her bet and I won my $20 lol

That year Titanic came out a bunch of us went to see it like four times I even saw it with a fellow night auditor that I used to talk to. Have to call around and ask for people their occupancy and the rates. 

Got that horrible job selling Tri-Star, vacuum cleaners, also known as the silver pig. What a piece of junk, we are told not to wrap the cord around the device probably cause the wires were gonna snap because they were a low quality. This is the only time in my life I‚Äôve ever done any type of salesman position absolutely hated it. First of all, I‚Äôm a terrible liar. I‚Äôm not going to pretend that I absolutely love something when I don‚Äôt know anything about it. And then the guys I worked with were such scumbags. One time we were driving towards Springfield on 57 in Agawam and I was following these guys throwing so much trash out the window. It probably would‚Äôve been like a $10,000 fine. lol And I‚Äôm supposed to respect these kind of people that‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous.I felt terrible at this time of my life. I had so much anxiety I remember sitting in that crummy little building at the end of 57 in Southwich.202.




That I got a job learning how to do roofing so I did that all summer  



fall while I was dating sf. We made a couple trips down to Delaware that summer I got a ticket for speeding even though I wasn't speeding. Feeling really sick in Delaware and then my car started acting up and nobody wanted to help. Some bad gas in the car wouldn't accelerate over 50 miles an hour and that was a long drive home with three women in a baby and they wouldn't change his diaper I remember. I got mad and yelled at him and pulled over and forced them to change his diaper when he was screaming and as soon as they changed his diaper he stopped crying. Some women are so lazy and ridiculous it's unimaginable I started going to court so I had to get a different job so I started working at Bradco roofing supply and then I got laid off for Christmas.

met SF moved to agawam. big mistake. Man I met her through a friend and he was friends with Bonnie who was fri I met some people SF, and my dad gave me grief about staying out too much and I wasn‚Äôt feeling well and I felt rebellious so I moved out into some one. I didn‚Äôt know his apartment in Agawam and that was a disaster.


I remember running into my cousin Bryan Stebbins At a Chinese food restaurant in West Springfield, Massachusetts. He was by himself and I was with an ex-girlfriend at the time, and I started chatting with him and we sat with him If he really wanted company, but I always liked hanging out with him and talking with him. This is the last time I ever saw him alive again. ends with the mother of my daughter tony Davidson.


At Christmas time after picking Samantha up I was heading home driving down Parker Street at the corner of Wolverham Road who were stopped at a green light some old man got out of the car went and tried to grab the handle to Samantha's door I jumped out of the car and started punching him in the face and there's blood everywhere and I didn't even realize I left my car in drive in it pumped into his bumper. Well the cops arrived they told me I should have strangled them to death and should have kept beating them




 1999 Moving on without wondering why

1999

Indoor flea market in Agawam next to the movie Plex

So I started off 1999 I don't know if I was working at red roof yet or if I just started but I'd gotten this job because I went out during a major storm snowstorm and I was filling out applications and the manager was impressed that I was willing to keep looking for a job even though the weather was crummy 


I haven't forgotten what DSS ignored in Massachusetts back in 1999. 

I also haven't forgotten how the Agawam police department Falsely arrested me on that BS restraining order violation.

Or how the Commonwealth misled me and with the help of attorney Brian Blackburn. they were able to coerce me into pleading guilty to that continuation without a finding, telling me it was a good thing, it wouldn't be on my record, attorney Blackburn lied to me, telling me fighting it could take decades and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Even though the judge said out loud that this evidence didn't fit the charges, the judge was referring to the statement written by a friend of the person who claimed I violated this restraining order. That statement from her friend clearly said I asked her friend what was going on, I never made any attempt to contact the person who filed the restraining order or ask to pass any messages along. That judge should have thrown that charge out right then and there, instead of accepting that continuation without a finding plea. 













I haven't forgotten that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts doesn't want me opening my big mouth

Nathan was born March 17th I never met him

fall

working at the Red Roof Inn in West Springfield. I used to play chess with my buddy Chuck every single night all night, he was the security guard. Every morning we would do the word jumble in the newspaper and the crypto Quip. In fact he was the first person to make me aware of Mingles, my soon to be favorite karaoke bar( it's closed for good). Chuck would walk over there when his shift started later. He didn't have a car at the time, so I would pick him up for work every night and drop him off when I left. We used to go to a bar Joey's pub in Agawam. That was my first real bar experience we used to play chess at the bar, I loved the Crossword Jumble on the bar-top arcade. Photo-hunt was a awesome group gam, we'd also play pool and darts. Chuck would sing karaoke but I was too much of a chicken back then. We used to go to Joey's pub before we would head downtown Springfield to the hot club and other bars on Worthington St. Chuck and I used to watch wrestling all the time back in 1999-2004 wrestling was huge and hilarious. I got sick with hyperthyroidism again in 2003 after my youngest son was born. Unfortunately I become low energy and get erectile dysfunction when I'm sick, so that caused problems in my marriage. 


My neighbor Dave across the street convinced me to switch jobs so I left the night auditor job and started working at a heating and air conditioning warehouse control air supply

On New Year's Eve I had my sister shut the power off and scared JK she was terrified that the world was going to end because it was Y2K




 2000 Rushing into things



 2000

Had my tonsils out in the spring while I was working for control air supply. I‚Äôll have to get the exact date at some point but in the spring or summer of 2000 I needed to have my tonsils removed. For years before this, I would feel something rubbing the back of my tongue and when I look in my throat, I‚Äôd see a little white dot protruding from my tonsil. So I‚Äôll grab a toothbrush and squeeze the hell out of it to get that tonsil stone out. Those things would smell absolutely disgusting so I gave my doctor crap about it so they would do something about it. I‚Äôm not sure if it was a great idea to have my tonsils removed, but it bothered me other time so I did and I don‚Äôt know what was causing those tonsil stones.

I had surgery and I don‚Äôt believe I follow the doctors orders. I ate Velveeta shells and cheese soon after surgery and I remember coding the back of my throat. They did laser surgery so you could see burnt flesh. I ended up going back to work and not taking any time off to heal and three or four days later my throat split open and blush started gushing out of my mouth while I was at work.

I don‚Äôt know why I decided to fill a large 16 ounce red solo cup with that blood and carry it through the warehouse outside and then asked a coworker to bring me to the emergency room, but while I was standing there waiting to leave with that massive cup of blood in my hand, I decided to throw it at the side of the building, and it looked like two golf ball clumps of blood stuck to the wall and blood splattered all over the place. It was hilarious and disgusting at the same time. I remember a buddy of mine telling me how gross it was to have to use the hose to spray it off the building after that.


I ended up needing to have surgery again to close up the wounds and this time the surgery was successful and I didn‚Äôt have any issues  lol

So I went to work that morning and back of my throat was in a decent amount of pain. But I was young and dumb. I never even bothered looking in the back of my throat to see if there was swelling or anything. 


I can‚Äôt recall how long I was there, but all of a sudden the pain disappeared and my mouth started filling up with blood. I rushed to the bathroom and grabbed a cup. Some blood got in the sink, swallowed a lot of it, but there was so much I had to use the cup to start catching it. How I was holding my neck made a difference in how much blood was gushing out, so I held my head funny and brought the cup with me as I walked across the warehouse and was able to ask for a ride to the emergency room in between spitting blood out. It was so gross to swallow. 


My buddy Steve brought me to the ER. We had a good laugh about the blood on the way. He ended up leaving me there and headed back to work. I got stuck waiting for a couple hours. Once my neck got weak and I couldn‚Äôt hold it up, I started bleeding all over the floor in the waiting room.

That‚Äôs when nurses rushed out and brought in me to triage. I was shipped off to surgery right then and there.


When I woke up I was in the children‚Äôs area of the hospital, they needed me to stay overnight and this was the only area available. It worked out for me, Jamie was able to stay the night because they had accommodations for parents to stay with kids and I had a tv in my private room. Something that wasn‚Äôt normal for the time. Even cell phones weren‚Äôt special back then. I remember Jamie left to get something to eat and all of a sudden I started to feel super weak. So I decided to walk to the bathroom and also remember thinking about get something to drink. They had a shelf with cups and a water pitcher, but as I neared that area I had to tech for the bathroom door as fast as I could, before I could even register what was happening, I projectile vommited all that dried blood I swallowed all over the bathroom, but I instantly felt like a million bucks, you couldn‚Äôt tell I had surgery. 

Fix Ricky lol

I started feeling sick again in spring of 2000, I was working at a heating and air conditioning warehouse because a neighbor across the street had asked me to switch jobs in the summer of 1999, so I left the night auditor job at the Red Roof Inn and started working there at the warehouse. When I first started working at that heating and air conditioning warehouse I felt like an animal. Even stop driving to work and started riding my bicycle I would race the neighbor who lived across the street to work every morning and home every night and I would beat him every single time. And then I got injured when some pipe fell and cut my leg and it's around that time that I had another mental collapse. i didn't understand what was going on and I think everybody thought I was a fool and faking it. but I had more issues going on than just the cut on my leg. I started having severe depression and panic attacks for no reason and then I got married in August of 2000 after asking a girl i  barely knew a year to marry me on mothers day of 2000. I was in a big rush for everything, my anxiety was on overdrive and I don't know what I was thinking. I also don't want to blame everything on my hyperthyroidism. I'm sure there were times where it was just pure anxiety and panic, because I felt like I had all these unrealistic expectations placed upon me and I couldn't even explain why I was having problems in the first place. I was in a rush to be normal and not have people asking me what I'm doing, so started racing forward without thinking things through.



Ask JS to marry me on mother's Day

J S's mother was not happy that I asked her to marry her on mother's Day she acted like I did it to spite her.

We used to visit JS's great grandparents and her grandparents all the time I really enjoyed that


Married JS in August at Cape Cod Beach


Party at my cousin Ellie's after this but JS's sister didn't show up her mother had planned a different party they are all very nasty to each other they still are 



 2001

 2001 

It was around this time that I went to Springfield Technical Community College and took a review for college writing and a self paced math course.


i still have the chair from her mother's and ed tyburski, it's still in the basement. 



2002

 2002 

june 16 uncle norman died


I was working at the Howard Johnson Hotel at this time

I recall I started feeling sick again in April , my wife at the time had moved out  April or mayand I was fighting the courts to also try to see my daughter who was born in 1997, her mother and I were never married, then she offered me a chance to stop fighting because she saw how the physical effects of dealing with the courts were taking their toll on me and she actually showed mercy. Regardless of any issues we ever had, she showed me more compassion than the courts ever did. 


I threatened to kill myself in front of Judge Lions at one point she was fired for her disgusting behavior towards citizens i'm not even sure how she lasted as long as she did. well I guess I am sure because I know how the system works

I feel like a scumbag father for agreeing to give up fighting for visitation in exchange to stop paying a few dollars in child support a week. When I'm sick like that I don't think straight, and in May 2002 MM told me that "you know the state will never stop, they'll never help you, they're just going to keep jerking you around forever." Then she told me "You deserve a break" and in my weakened mental state I agreed with her. Anyone that knows me knows I'm a real pain in the rear end when I'm feeling healthy. 

So looking back I just feel like a complete loser for doing that, for giving up when I felt like I was winning. Like I was getting close to not just getting visitation, I was confident I could get joint custody of one of my kids and custody of the other.

I broke up from with my first wife for a short time around this time period. when she came back, she got pregnant right away.

Before Christmas I was laid off from the Howard Johnson Hotel. The manager was having trouble with someone that lived there and thought that I had helped that person hide AVHS Cassette of her son who happened to be the janitor and that person having a fight in the office. No idea where that tape went or what their fight was about.




 2003

The beginning of 2003 was rough my cousin Brian died he was the only forty years old. I remember his wake in West Springfield and then the family went back to the agawam sportsman's club just to celebrate his life. I remember hanging out with James Misty and Amber and listening to their mom talk about how she planned on coming back and fixing up the sportsman's club because her father owned it and was a family type business place to hang out. Love going there I got to shoot guns we get to go fishing there was a little pond there, it's been torn down now there's some apartments i'm not sure if that pond is still there

My ex wife JS moved back around June 2002 and got pregnant and our son was born in February of 2003. Dietrich's birth was pretty rough he was stuck in the neonatal intensive care unit for weeks. It didn't help that I fell absolutely terrible and then my newborn son was helpless stuck in a hospital and I couldn't do anything to help him

It was right after our son was born that I really started to suffer some serious mental effects from my hyperthyroidism again and trying to treat it by talking to doctors and receiving depression medication made it all worse. We were living off of Boston Road at the time,  My wife and I were having troubles because of my mental health issues. 

Lisa Strong was murdered April 30th 2003 she was buried alive after being shot by her psychotic boyfriend this is down in South or North Carolina

 I still remember the toothpick Dick Rick jokes SF made, ha ha ha. It's a shame too, after that I started calling myself Ricky again. Please Commonwealth of Massachusetts don't tell me you're going to pretend you don't remember that's how I got the restraining order removed around 2003 too, I got lucky and someone heard her mocking me in the hall at court, calling me toothpick Dick Rick, toothpick Dick Rick. Then she was forced to admit that I never did anything and there was reason to believe I would stab anyone with anything for any reason, let alone a stupid toothpick. Seriously???




One night after jamie came home late we'd gotten in an argument and she'd left crying, so I cut up some of her jewelry and scratched some of her favorite pans while I was having a panic attack, she had been drinking and she just took our son drive for a drive up to Moss Road to a cousin's house where her sister was staying. Her sister was dating my cousin at the time. She was drunk and called the cops and said we were having a fight. When the police showed up they gave me a choice they said they could arrest her for drunk driving and child endangerment or they could arrest me and she'll be able to keep her job in her license. So obviously that didn't leave me much of a choice I allowed myself to be arrested, and then the charges were dropped shortly after.

It was around this time I was fixing up my mother's bathroom because we only lived like 1/2 mile away so I would bring Dietrich over here and that summer the house was robbed while I was working on the house. Jamie and I were going to move back in because I was struggling and she was only thinking of herself as always that's how she is even now and I'm going to prove that with messages I have with her so we ended up getting an apartment in West Springfield right next to mingles, but I never went there at that time

Our relationship was a disaster after that and she wanted to move and that's when I met Ira Bloom. I got into a rent to own situation with this mentally disturbed person. At first I thought he was just a concerned father who was having a hard time in his divorce from his wife and I understood because I was having trouble with my wife as well. He told me his X was physically abusing their son and had heard him at the Jewish Community Center in Longmeadow MA and asked if I would call the Department of social services anonymously and say I witnessed some abuse and ask for someone to investigate and I did. Granted it was probably not the brightest idea but I wasn't thinking straight at the time and I didn't think I was hurting anybody by asking someone to investigate an alleged assault allegation. My wife and son had moved to West Springfield at the time and this man kept calling me all the time with concerns and problems. Then my wife and I began renting a house from her father in Springfield Off of Berkshire Ave. Which was unfortunately closer to Boston Road, so this mentally disturbed man contacted me more and more. One day out of the blue he brought up my friend Tammy Lynds who was found dead on Fox Road and asked if I would murder his ex-wife because of the abuse but she was inflicting upon their son, he also told me that he would pay me for my services. He told me he wanted me to murder her rape her and dump her body in another state and make it look like she was robbed At that point I had a friend anonymously called the police and report what Ira had said. I also contacted someone who I knew was looking out for Ira, who helped him pay for our rent a own situation and this man paid the balance of Ira's blooms bill, so that I wouldn't have to deal with Ira ever again, which I was very grateful for. I felt like such a piece of trash when that guy asked me to do that, I couldn't understand how any one would ask me of all people to do something so horrific and bring up my friend who was found dead on the side of the road.



I was also taking ephedra when I was working-out back then, so that didn't help, that gave me a lot of anxiety and caused my heart to race. I was having random uncontrollable panic attacks and I didn't understand what was happening to me at the time, I was struggling trying to hold it together. I told all the doctors I saw and they thought I was faking. We did try seeing a marriage counselor but that was a total disaster. This guy blamed it all on her and then I left those marriage counseling sessions feeling like somebody just told you I told you you were right all along. I'm sure that was terrible for our relationship, I'm sure I was a pompous rear end after that. I used to take my son jogging in the cemetery right up the street every day with our dog, we had a different Pomeranian Hailey back then. I used to love doing that but I would come back really low energy and I don't believe my ex-wife enjoyed that.

August 28th 2003 Grandma Francis died that was terrible I remember my uncle coming up and he was very upset because he felt like he should have spent more time on there and I always wondered why he would cry when it was his own fault that he didn't spend time with his mother


Jamie used to cheat on me all the time. Her and  buddies at the salon she worked that used to snort Coke and get drunk in the parking lot every night. They were all a bunch of party animals. I remember when the owner died from liver disease. Everyone was worried it was hepatitis because they all use these dollar bills rolled up the snort together.


So the first time I told you, I cut up some of Jamie‚Äôs jewelry scratched couple of her pants, cause she was cheating on me and then grabbed my son and ran off drunk driving.

Another time that I caught her cheating. I don‚Äôt know if I told you this. When I first met her in 1999 she got a job at a porn shop called book ends in Enfield Connecticut. That‚Äôs how I met my buddy Paul. She was friends with her first, but she also worked with this guy Hector. A few years later after our son was born she started getting drunk and hanging around with him and sleeping with him. And then I found out in one night when I was up sick and full of anxiety. He had texted her phone and I saw that she was out cold, so texted him back and  invited him to park up the street. I told him I would come outside. The sky waited outside for like 3 1/2 hours and I kept flicking the light in the front of the house. lol I would text him back that Ricky just woke up. I‚Äôll be out in a minute. lol 

The next day he found out it was me came over and I was standing in the driveway and wanted to fight. They used to call him fat and stinky and he is so lucky that I was sick at the time because if I felt the way I do now back then and this loser came to my house to start a fight with me while my infant child was there, I would break him in ways. He can‚Äôt even imagine. lol  I was too sick to even call the cops. I was stupid and just totally out of it. lol not anymore
I also threatened to kill myself in front of judge lying I believe, I was sent to Baystate by ambulance and was released shortly after. 

My wife and I had split up and I was staying at my mother's house. One night in a manic episode, I took a Dremel and scratched the tattoos on my left arm, and then wrapped bleach in a paper towel around one of the tattoos in an attempt to remove it. It was my wife's name at the time. Listen to me everyone don't get people's name statute on you. lol It was horrible I had a chemical burn, and I still have a scar from it. My arm swelled up in a very strange way around my elbow for weeks and I didn't go to the doctor's. I was a complete disaster.




2004

 2004

 At the time I was also going to the Red Cross on Cottage Street in Springfield, I had started taking classes to become a certified nurse's aide. I remember getting straight A's in that class and the teacher told me that I really need to advance in my education and stop aiming so low. I took that as a compliment but I felt absolutely horrible at the time physically and mentally so I didn't do anything with it. After medical assisting school I started working at Wingate at Wilbraham it was nursing home for the elderly. I enjoyed the people there but I thought it was a prison for the elderly in my honest opinion. I don't think those people were treated right. I took every opportunity I could to walk people outside on my breaks even though management tried to discourage me from doing it. I even found out that one of my aunts was staying there, a great aunt on my father's side and I started making nightly visits to her. It's sad that I can't remember her name at the moment but she was a very nice woman, she was related to my grandma Stebbins was originally Picard, I even used to bring my son to work to show the elderly people , I would always try to cheer them up on my days off and I loved seeing my aunt, she would light up like a Christmas tree when she saw him. 



 Back when I was married to my youngest son‚Äôs mother Jamie, we were trying to go see a marriage counselor. And the guy took my side of the story like gospel. I remember leaving these therapy sessions feeling so vilified I think that‚Äôs the word. I left there practically telling her this guy thinks you‚Äôre a piece of crap too. Which definitely did not help my attitude. But I was sick at the time so I thought that that was a good idea, to blame her for what is obviously a two person problem. So many things happen in such a short period of time man my life is absolutely ridiculous.

I was taking online courses at Stcc we were living on Welland Ave in Indian Orchard I'd worked one day at Circuit City and then had a panic attack and then maybe January I started going to CNA school and this is around the time I used to Dremel tool all the scratch those tattoos on my left arm and put the bleach on it

I can't remember exactly how this unfolded at the moment but while I was working at the nursing home a friend of mine started working there and I started contemplating hurting myself because of the way I was feeling in the failures of my life and I couldn't understand why they were happening. One night I asked her how much alcohol it would take someone was trying to off themselves. Then I went to the store and grabbed a large bottle of vodka and a pint of Captain Morgan's 151 and I drank it as fast as I could, then I went and laid in the basement at the home we rented from her father. We were splitting up at that point, so I don't know what I was really thinking ,but I wasn't really thinking straight, so that's what I did. They just left me laying on the floor, so when I woke up in the morning I had rhabdomyolysis in my muscles in my right peck and right quad and had to be brought to the emergency room. I spent a week or so at Bay State hospital before I was sent to their Psych Ward for a week or so. Being locked in a hospital wasn't good for me, the medications they were giving me were making my anxiety and panic attacks so bad that one night while someone was leaving during a visit I managed to escape Even though my chest and leg were killing me and I was having trouble walking, I was able to outrun the staff down the stairs out the hospital and up the street. I feel bad for this woman now but when people are having panic attacks they have energy that normal people don't understand. Unfortunately staff gave police a wrong description of the clothes I was wearing so I was able to walk all the way back to our home that I had shared my ex and our son. I was completely out of my mind but for some reason I thought that spending time with my son would make me feel better but when I got to the house there was a different car there and when I looked through the front window my ex was having sex with her future ex husband on the couch. lol I remember telling different therapists this years later and they all laughed, they all asked if it was a rude awakening. I asked all of them where was my son, why wasn't anyone there for me emotionally, or concerned about my well being? lol

At some point after getting out of the hospital, I got and I was using that to drive back-and-forth to Holland mass to see friends in Holyoke. My car was weird the rear end felt like it was shifting like there was something wrong with the suspension.

April 14







I was such a disaster at the time I allowed my ex-wife to convince me to sign my rights away to my son and allow our friend her future ex husband to adopt my son. She told me how strong he was and how much he loves my son and wishes he was his own and that their best friends and that my son already calls him dad and doesn't remember me. I remember thinking my son deserves the best and I will complete mess and she's right. Looking back I feel like a complete idiot, but what do you do when you're a complete disaster and you're sick. I really wish I had somebody there to prevent me from making all these terrible mistakes on my own, someone to talk to try to sort things out, someone to do some blood work lol 2005 was the last time I hung-out with my son. I let all my friends down my family down, that was the last time I saw Chuck for over a decade, and it's a shame how friendships fall apart when someone gets sick and people don't understand what's going on.


May 9th the 12th I was in Baystate ICU and from May 13th to 27th I was in Baystate Psych Ward


June: Once I got off all the psych meds that the doctors had put me on I felt so much healthier even though I didn't feel great it was still a real struggle. Plus I felt stupid because no one wanted to talk about what had happened every one just wanted to ignore it. And said I looked great and I was doing fine and that was enough.

July 13th our divorce was finalized

SS moved in with her kids we dated for the summer ended up breaking up after Dominic was born some point. And that‚Äôs why I start going to the Rex.



 April 23 bobby and Joe Ferrero win first place At an hour and 20 minutes and 36 seconds in the aluminum class at the Westfield river races, gets me excited. it reminded me of when Shawn had raced years ago

I started working for Sullivan and Associates after leaving Aditus after catching them abusing mentally challenged people violating their rights and reporting it. one lady used a broom handle to lock a kid in his room. That's when I really started to notice that these so called mental health professionals are really incompetent and there's some of the laziest most worthless bastards this world has ever seen. All of the managers well several one there's one that was really nice except for this one manager all these other people were scum and if I could get everyone on camera and force these issues out in the open they would probably end up in jail.

2006 Dominic was born August 18th. I remember going to the hospital that day my jeep I think it stalled on the way there. I want to go visit my father and Mary in Vermont right after. Dominic's birth is obviously a highlight in my life. We've been best buddies ever since he was born and I've got hundreds of pictures of him.

picture take 8-24. we started hanging out early.





The girl Suzanne I was dating and her two children moved out around September or October. I was a train wreck around this time. Couldn't understand why I felt so terrible and so weak So I ruined that relationship.


Around September I started going to the Rex to hang out with Amy and Stephen Michon and that's where I met Reno and started singing karaoke. The first song I ever sang alone was Hold Me Now by the Thompson Twins. lol Back in like 1994 my cousin Joey and I tried to sing some boys to men at a birthday party at Club Meadows in East Longmeadow but I don't remember taking that seriously and I'm sure I wasn't putting any effort into it like I did as an adult. Hanging out at the Rex was the greatest time in the world, there was hardly anyone ever there so we could sing any songs we wanted every night over and over and when we sucked we could just stop and nobody cared. I got to practice songs and realize that my voice is pretty terrible for a lot of songs lol But I felt way more comfortable singing with just a couple of people there than I did in front of a room full of strangers. 

2006 Leo n. Gero died 10-3 Born 2-24-1916 brother to Francis, Flossie and Pearl. one arm was always in a sling, he was hit by a car after rolling down a hill as a kid.

Karaoke with Steve, I used to go to the rex and downtown to sing and hangout. Ran into uncle Fred/Aunt Keri in her older years. I called out to uncle Fred and he didn't respond, Paul asked what his female name was and I happened to have heard it and when we called Keri, he and his buddies all ran over in their sun dresses and chatted for a few.




Was hanging out with Mary Wallbridge and her friends from the 99 restaurant and going downtown a lot. It was somewhere around this point in my life I adopted the idea that I was just going to say yes every time some one asked me to do something. There are times I noticed I just felt super depressed I would just stay home and do nothing, so I wanted to make sure I broke that horrible habit.





April 21st I did the Westfield Wildwater Canoe races, my brother raced with Joe Ferrero, they came in second place at one hour two minutes and 24 seconds, and I raised with Dennis Olisky, we came in 4th place at an hour and six minutes and 27 seconds

2007 Donat E Soucy died 1-20 born 1-30-1929 married to Agnes father to Robert Soucy, grandfather to Robert and Eric Soucy


2007- Sullivan and associates- So I got let go from Sullivan Associates because I filed too many complaints against employees who were not doing their jobs or abusing people with disabilities. They even tried transferring me to other houses but I improved those other houses when I worked there as well and I was making everyone look bad just by having fun and being a normal human being. Don't forget about that guy I used to have to bring the Worcester for therapy sessions. When I first started working first Sullivan and Associates the house they gave me was a complete disaster. This was my first experience as a manager of anything. It took me like two months to get that house in working order and after I was done it ran so smoothly that I made everyone else in the company look bad and I started to make a lot of enemies. First off I created a standard form for medication to bring to the doctors so that there would be no more confusion. Understand why the state doesn't have a standard form for every company. Manager was allowed to create whatever type of form they wanted when bringing clients to the doctors. And then I started making staff interact with the clients and bring them places. Are going to the gym every single day and people complained, not the clients but other staff. I used to take the clients to the gym by myself and then we'd go to big Y every night to buy whatever they would like for dinner and then we would grill it. Before I started all the guys ate was pasta and hotdogs every night, I thought that was most disgusting thing I ever heard in my entire life. After work with me for a couple of months these guys were in the best shape of their lives, we went to the casino a couple of times, we went to the mall all the time, we went hiking all the time, and 1 of the guys had leg problems it was supposed to wear leg braces but he loved walking so much without them,  that he got to the point where he didn't need them. I started filing a lot of complaints about the abuse and neglect I was witnessing in other homes and by staff members that worked in the house that I managed. Then my program manager tried getting me to work at other locations and tried to give me kids that they considered troubled. They sent me to a house in Hadley thinking that I would get upset having to deal with this one guy that was a runner, but they were in for a rude awakening because as soon as that guy took off out the door I took off after him but I didn't yell I just jogged behind him. It was like three miles up the road where this autistic adult males like 23 maybe 25 years old, he stopped running, turned around and said he had to go to bathroom. lol We were too far away from the house at that point so I had them pee in the woods, I think this guy was shocked that I even offered that idea. We walked back to the House and he didn't talk anymore when we got back to the house we went in the backyard and I asked him if he wanted to play catch and he looked like the happiest guy in the world for the next three hours. The other employee in the house sat there watching BET the entire time, and didn't interact with this client at all. No wonder these people like to run they're constantly neglected. That's probably the only attention he'd got ever from the staff is when he ran. lol

I was laid off not that long after this, I had received a phone call that one of the clients was destroying the House and I needed to show up at the home right away, this was like 8:00 o'clock in the morning. When I get to the house the living room and kitchen are all smashed, the microwaves on the floor, the toasters on the floor, the tv had a crack across the screen. lol Dishes were everywhere, it was hilarious because I was not used to anything like that at all. The female staff member had to leave at that point saying she was late for something and I stayed and spoke with the client who decided to smash the house. He had quite the story. Told me that he wasn't feeling well, He said that when he told the other coworker that had just left that he didn't want to go to work today because he didn't feel well that she grabbed his leg, yanked him out of bed and he fell on the floor. Now I'd work with this guy for some time at this point and he was the sweetest older gentleman you could ever imagine working with he was the nicest easiest guy and he never ever gave anyone a hard time so I believe him when he said that this lady was a monster and grabbed her by the leg and yanked him onto the floor because she just wanted to leave and wanted him to go to work.





2007- Unemployment I could have looked for a job but I was so disgusted that they fired or not fired me but let me go because I was doing a great job and they had to pay for it so I just took that time to spend time helping other people


June Texas Vacation



I thought I would be so cool to swim underneath these falls and man was I was in for a rude awakening because there were little rattlesnakes all up on the rocks underneath there and that was terrifying lol

August 1st Took Dom to the zoo with some chick I meant. Pretty sure she thought I was gay because I didn't make any moves on her. I still felt like a train wreck and didn't know what to do with my life so I was not in the mood put the moves on any one. Who am I kidding, I've never put the moves on anyone. lol

I'm met AM the girl with the white shirt sitting in the chair shortly after breaking up with SS. We used to go play pool in West Springfield and then we went and sang karaoke at the Rex. She had gotten pregnant at one point and tried to say it was mine. lol I used to have the results but I had a blood test done just to prove that I wasn't the baby's daddy.

February 7th I got it a bar fight at the Rex Karaoke Club in Chicopee. It was not my fault I was minding my own business. Either way I was sitting at a table my Friend Darlene was sitting across the table with her back to the wall my friend Reno was sitting to my right and we were just talking, goofing around and waiting for our turns to sing karaoke. This guy that looked just like Magnum Pi, He had the 80s hair mustache he was tall and muscular , he went over and stood between Reno and Darlene. He started whispering something in her ear and I guess his mustache brushed her neck and she asked him to stop. People said something to me but I didn't witness this incident so I didn't care, lol  I wasn't going to get upset over nothing. A few minutes go by and this guy's back over next to Darlene and something happened, so Reno asks the guy nicely to step away and says that she asked you not to do that And that's when this Magnum Pi looking guy looks Reno right in the face and says "you want a punch in the mouth" and he just punched him in the mouth. lol 

Looking back now, I don't think that guy Reno that hard in the mouth, but it was the heat of the moment so I just responded. Before Reno even had time to touch his lip, I burst from my chair, I shoved her you know out of the way, which incidentally threw him to the floor by accident, and I started punching the sky in the face and his head started bouncing off the wall. I had him like 15 times before my father yanked me away and the sky felt at a floor blood pouring from his nose and mouth. Two of my friends tried to help him up and in the heat of the moment I yanked myself away from my father and soccer kicked the sky in the face before he even had a chance to get off the ground. It was horrifying, I've never seen a body just drop limp like that to the ground before. But this guy was a lot bigger than me and he just started swinging so I didn't know what to do. When the cops got there they were congratulating me, they said this guy has been going to local bars and picking fights with all kinds of people. The people in the ambulance were laughing because I broke this guy's nose and he had a 3 inch gash across his forehead. They said I was about time this guy got his ass kicked. But honestly I felt like a piece of crap. I think the worst part for me was that my right hand and my right foot both hurt for over a month after that. Every time I went to the gym I was reminded of that fight. But I still know I was in the right, so what are you going to do lol.






Picture of the bruise on Reno's arm for me throwing them to the ground lol 

We had to go to court over this a couple months later and we signed paperwork saying we didn't remember what happened that night. The lawyer that was helping my buddies since he was assaulted by this guy told me that I should become a lawyer or an investigator. After these charges were dismissed this guy still wanted to fight me he felt like I had cheated because he hit my friend and then I hit him. lol I think the worst part of this was this guy was like 10 or 15 years older than I was. People never grow up this guy should have been acting like an adult and here he was looking to get knocked out again.

Saturday April 19th Westfield Wildwater Canoe races, Saturday I raced with Dara in the aluminum canoe, and my dad and brother raced in a Coleman. I felt so bad for Dara this entire race we zigzagged back and forth we spun around like a bunch of goofballs and I had no idea that it was all the canoes fault. She probably thought I stunk lol 

Dara and I came in 12th place at that hour and 12 minutes and 53 seconds in recreation mixed male female class. My brother and father came in 29th place at an hour and 25 minutes and 40 seconds in the Coleman class










I'm pretty sure I bragged bragged about how we are going to kick ass and then then we spun around right here like a bunch of goofballs and it was terrible we lost so much time and we did so much worse than I thought we were going to do. lol I really don't stink that bad lol









Sunday the 20th I did the pro canoe races with Joe Ferrero and I got my picture in the city newspaper. I think it's hilarious that my buddy got cut out of the picture lol


Found the pic I paid for off of the newspaper website





Before the race he told me the only way that he gets pumped up is if somebody sticks a finger in his belly button apparently I didn't stick my finger in far enough because we didn't win the race












April 30th Testing Dom's grip strength I don't know how long it took before you could actually do a pull up LOL

This was taken father's Day June 15th one of the last times that I remember seeing Kirk



In June of this year I thought it would be hilarious to take this photo and have a poster made at Walgreens because they would mail it and everything,  it totaled like 20 bucks, I couldn't resist I thought it was the funniest thing in the world. So I had my sister take the picture, I uploaded it to Walgreens and I just waited for a response. My uncle ended up calling me like two weeks later asked me what the hell I was thinking. lol When I went from vacation in 2009 he had it hanging above the mantle in his living room, he had taken some thumbtacks and pinned it there just before I arrived. it was absolutely hilarious. lol


Kathy also shaved Dominick's head for the first time this summer





Quabbin trip June 



July back to Mt Tom we went a lot that year. Paul told me to try to look like beaker from the Muppets, so I try to suck my face in as best I could. I think I did a good job. lol







2008- Charles "Bill" Cote died 8-16 born 12-30-1932 Erica Stebbins Grandfather, used to go swimming at their house


This is one of the most exciting times I had in Vermont, I jumped off the bridge this time you can see in the picture below I spent a lot of time with my dad which I always liked. I kayak down this river almost caught a fish and it flipped the kayak and I almost lost the camera that I had I only ended up losing the pliers that my dad loaned me there at the bottom of the river somewhere.

2008 Kirk Anthony Intellisano died 11-28 Born 6-13-1973 Nephew Dominic's father. hung-out a few times. nice guy with struggles. I remember I was devastated when Kirk died because Dominic was just a baby and I knew what it would be like for him to grow up without a father. I think the worst part is somebody called me at work and told me I was working out the country and in sweets in Holyoke and there was nothing I could do about it, just sit at work alone and have a panic attack lol


December 2008- 




I think it was December I started doing cross stitching at work. I started getting bored just sitting there. This is around the time that my elbow started to really burn as well. My forearms felt like they were on fire all the time and the doctor didn‚Äôt believe me


December taking Valium and it didn't help at all.

I used to stand in the corner a lot as a kid. i offered to let Dom try, but this was the end of it. lol

2009

 The beginning of 2009 I was so bored at work working at the country and in suites I started building matchstick models, I put plastic models together, and I started doing cross stitching just to help pass the time.


Hello, they used to sell the coolest designs for cross stitching at these hobby shops so now they don‚Äôt even have hobby shops like they used to 

February 20






march 2009 Took down with my sister and a girlfriend db and her kids to the Springfield Science Museum. I've always loved coming here and they had a better dinosaur exhibit this time around





March  I worked for Allied rehab around this time in Connecticut I remember my knee was hurting and I felt absolutely terrible at work and I still worked harder than those fat lazy slobs my manager was the biggest piece of trash. I only work for this company for a few months I got the job through Mary Walbridge because her sister was a program manager at this company and this lady had the worst attitude ever. I have never worked for a company that has helped those with disabilities that has used the word retard more than this company. I worked with some of the laziest people in the world, I got in trouble because I would volunteer to do stuff and then say I don't care. Somebody tried to call me out in front of a group of people for saying I don't care, saying it sounds terrible when you say that. And then I pointed out in front of everyone I'm the only one who volunteers to ever do anything, I don't think any of these jobs are really that big of a deal and I don't see why anyone complains. I was let go laid off not that long after that. lol 

                                                                         Holyoke Road race










Saturday April 18th did the Westfield wild water canoe races my brother and Joe Ferrero got first place in the Coleman class and I got 4th place with Dennis Olisky






Early summer saw a blind therapist; thought I‚Äôd someone couldn‚Äôt see me, they wouldn‚Äôt judge me by my looks.  I don't know why I wasted my time, I tried my hardest talking to these people but no one ever listened. No one ever really wanted to talk. I don't even understand what therapy is all about anymore, especially now that I've figured out my issues on my own and seeing what it took for me to do it.



June in Vermont with my dad by the river we saw these butterfly's




It was around June that DB and her kids moved out and her kids moved out. Early in the school year, I was in our backyard with Darlene, her kids and Dominic, I was pulling the kids down the slide of the swing set with a fort and slide. I was yanking the kids down the slide and flinging them onto a pile of chair cushions we had stacked at the bottom.  These were plastic slides, and they came in two pieces. When I put it together, I didn‚Äôt notice that some of these screws were longer than they should‚Äôve been, it had caused the plastic to deform slightly and the tip of one screw was 
 At one point Darlene‚Äôs daughter got a scratch on her leg. I‚Äôm not sure where it was on her leg, but she didn‚Äôt say anything when it happened. When her daughter went to school the next day, a teacher noticed the scratch and asked her what happened, she told the teacher that she got the scratch playing on the side slide with the kids and me. That started a DCF investigation. 
That woman from DCF was so rude and so disrespectful that I wanted punch her in the face. I have no problem saying that now because I‚Äôm gonna record every single conversation I have with every state worker ever so I don‚Äôt have these kind of fucking problems. That fracking bitch tried to imply that I intentionally hurt that young girl, and that I knew that the tip of the screw had began to press through the plastic, That fracking bitch told me I did it on purpose and I argued with her on the phone for a couple weeks and she insisted on a face-to-face meeting with me, Even though she already came and checked the backyard and saw what had caused the scratch. It was fracking pathetic, this screw was sticking out just enough to scratch your skin, but not enough to cause a serious Injury ever, it was close to a grain of fucking sand, but when I was yanking her down the slide, her weight and the momentum caught that spot just right.

Thinking about that fracking bitch still pisses me off. That Stupid scunt said I intentionally hurt that young girl by yanking her down the slide and not checking to see if there is a tiny piece of plastic out or noticed that it had deformed. lol That fucking bitch implied that I tried to hurt my nephew as well because I was doing the same thing with him.
It‚Äôs funny when I asked her daughter after the fact why she didn‚Äôt say anything to anyone, She told me she was having so much and she didn‚Äôt want me to stop yanking them down the slide. 
Unfortunately, that ruined things with Darlene And I. It caused all kinds of stress for absolutely no reason.

June 10 found baby raccoons in the street at work. One girl thought she heard screaming and it was these little guys.


I have some video of Dom spinning around in circles here at 5 mile pond as well I'm pretty sure that's my old boat motor I'll have to look as in pictures but I used to love going to 5 mile. I still love going to 5 mile I just don't have a boat anymore.


Cool little milk snake I caught at my cousin Ellie's house


July 6 I won a karaoke contest when the Jagermeister crew came to Mingle's bar and they asked people to sing a song and change one of the words to Jager. So instead of pour some sugar on me I sang pour some Jager on me instead. It was so hot, sticky sweet, pour some Jager on my meat. yeah lol



July of each trip to Old Lyme Beach it definitely is not as cool as Misquamicut in Rhode Island I need to fix the spelling I'm not fixing that right now





This summer I started seeing a blind therapist in the same building on Maple Street in Springfield as I saw therapists as the child in second 3rd and 4th 5th grade. I was seeing therapists at BHN before this but no one ever listened to what I was saying or paid attention for that matter. I honestly can't think of one therapist who has ever truly helped me come to any realizations at all. Every single therapist I've ever talked to has tried to help me forget about my issues and try to move on without ever discovering what caused my problems in the first place. I remember feeling really stupid talking to this blind woman as well, she would have me stare at the wall and try to focus on nothing, it would never bring me any closer to any of the issues I was trying to address. If anything their stupidity caused me more confusion. I'm not sure how long human beings have been trying to figure things out or to communicate with each other, but I can assure people that a therapists are some of the worst people at communicating what human beings are actually thinking and why. It takes more than 40 minutes every two to 4 weeks to learn what makes some one tick, you need to give people homework so they can figure themselves out. How the hell can you have therapists trying to help people when they don't even understand themselves?

DB and kids move out.

July 12 This picture was taken at Misquamicut Beach in Rhode Island I'm pretty sure this is the day I met Frank

 September 14 CT river with gang






October 24 Caught this little snake at Paul's apartment in stafford before I started becoming terrified of snakes for some reason. This is the first time in years that I'd seen a snake and picked one up. Touched a snake this small since I was a teenager


November I went to visit my uncle Chet in Austin we went to inner space cavern we went San Antonio and instead of letting me get out and visit the Alamo he just pointed to it as as we drove by lol He said look there it is and that was the end of that. lol 


I'm pretty sure the statue is in San Antonio. they have a river walk down there, it was really pretty


I can't remember which bar this was but I sang some karaoke while I was down there

February second ice fishing at 5-MILE. I think it was just Reno Brian and I that day I don't think anyone else showed up maybe. There was a few of us at this time that would meet up and go ice fishing. 




Brian was a big dude so you could imagine how big this bullhead was as he's holding his hand up next to it. this thing was a monster lol


2010 Misty Dawn Strong died 2-14 Misty was an awesome cousin, so many happy memories born 2-1-1982 daughter to Phil and Lisa Strong, older sister of James and Amber



I caught the biggest crampy I've ever seen at Dimmock Pond right there At Hubbard Park on Parker St

I'm not sure why my mental health records are not complete in this area I'm going to have to keep looking. I was going to the Griswold Center at this point after stopping seeing the blind therapist in Springfield. I can't remember what drugs I was taking but I remember bringing a couple ex girlfriends here to try to explain that I'm not the same person right now as I was when I was talking to them in the past. I tried to explain my erectile dysfunction, but it was like talking to a wall. Thankfully I had witnesses I mean I could probably call them and I'm sure they'd love to complain and moan about me, but there's proof that our mental health system is a total failure. Especially considering the fact that I figured this all out on my own without any higher education. I watched a lot of tv and read books I didn't go to college or write any type of thesis

Random visit to Ellie's house in Monson

Did the canoe rice with a girl I was dating JJ at the time In the Coleman class we came in 19th place at one hour 22 minutes and 47 seconds. My brother and his friend Todd were in Coleman class and came in 14th place at one hour 19 minutes and 27 seconds.

May 22nd we had a benefit golf tournament This was over at Veterans Memorial Golf Course on South Branch Parkway I've never done anything like that before, it was a lot of ridiculousness. lol someone flipped a golf cart. someone found a way to get the golf carts to go faster. And for some reason there were a lot of dead frogs all over the place.


May 29th went to a bunch of cool places fishing one spot was in Northampton and another was an Indian Orchard behind the factories I went with Brian and Frank.








There‚Äôs a boat launch above the dam, Brian caught a monster that day, Frank was struggling to keep up.

Below the dam


I caught this baby goose before we went fishing Indian Orchard and then I let Frank hold it. He asked me if it had teeth, I told him yes, he panicked and dropped it. Thankfully it landed in the grass but I didn't know that guys thought birds had teeth. lol Maybe it's a babysitter the most vicious of them all.

July 30 Took a ride up Redbridge fishing


I'm not sure what these remnants of the old factory are up in Red Bridge but it looks pretty cool


August 1st monster trucks at Stafford Springs Motor Speedway, I'm pretty sure this was his first monster trucks event, either way it was a blast, I've loved monster trucks since I was a child. It always reminds me of when my dad took a set of Springfield Civic Center To see them when we were kids


I'm writing this in the year 2025 so this was taken 15 years ago and I think I'm still a little bit taller than him, I'm not sure but I'm going to go with that. lol




We want camping in Sturbridge Mass this place is pretty awesome it had a pond and a indoor pool with a hot tub. They had karaoke, one of our songs got cut off because the adults felt that might have been a little too mature for children. My Buddy Reno wanted to sing nickelbacks figured you out. lol That's not allowed at campsites.



August 24th  took Dom to the Westfield International air show at Barnes, I've always loved going to these show since I was a little kid.




September I got the season pass for the Big E and I won this little monkey I met Brian to mark there almost every night I believe and norm. This monkey's still hanging in the basement it's 2025


September 30th went to a Bruins preseason game I've never gone to a professional hockey game before or since, it was a lot of fun, we saw some street performers outside playing drums on 5 gallon buckets, I got to take a picture with the team mascot.


For my birthday this year my friends held a party at Max cap








October 12th we went to Mikes corn maze


October 17th we went to 6 Flags and that's when I got my Green Lantern sweatshirt it was freezing that day


Went to the mingles Halloween party with the gang


What the casinos for somebody's birthday and I'm pushing Frank around in a wheelchair of the lookup which casino that is. More fun pushing him around at a wheelchair than I did gambling



































2010- Unemployment 2010




Saturday April 17th did the Westfield Wildwater canoe races I did Coleman class with Janine Jarvis my brother erased with Todd Collins


June Juston Pauze died 6-24 born 5-10-1978 high school buddy, died in motorcycle crash. used to go to bars and hangout at home.


Met Laura At Mingles, I really started talking to her after the 4th of July and talking about her medical assisting stuff and however seeing her there's a group photo of us at Mingles I don't think she's in it but all the rest of my buddies are. I thought I wrote this somewhere but I took Laura on a 4 mile slow walk when I first met her and explained that I didn't want to be in a relationship because I didn't understand what was wrong with me and I'd been struggling to figure it out for years



My dad bought a house in West Warren on South Street this year I moved in with my father during the fall, I was still going to mingles and I thought that living with my dad and living with a friend and her kids would help out but our communication was terrible in that only lasted for a couple months



2010 Advantage sale and marketing 2010-2012


started dating Laura on October I think or november , she moved into an apartment that was like a 100 feet away from my friend Paul and Stafford Springs so that gave me an excuse to go visit her more often and visit him that's another reason why we got so close


Laura bought me a telescope and that got me back into looking at the night sky that December 2010






2011

 I was still working at advantage sales and marketing at this time

January 7th or 8th we went bowling with the gang at Shaker Bowl in East Longmeadow and for pizza at the pizza shop on Shaker Rd. Started to snow while we were out and as we were pulling onto her street Laura Street in Stafford Springs we slid down the hill and we ended up crashing.



I don't know why I picked a picture of the tow truck to remind me of this but I'll find another picture later. Or maybe I took this picture to show how we're looking up a hill. When we crashed my door was jammed and Laura was yelling at me to get out of the car, She was panicking and I yelled back "how", I  ended up popping the seat back and then I crawled out the back passenger side door. 

Starting using the telescope that Laura bought me for Christmas. we moved in together Shortly after this. I almost forgotten about that car accident, I thought that I had talked her into moving in with me but this might have been one of the deciding factors as well.


The accident wasn't too bad because we went sledding at Mary Lynch field the next day with Dominic. I still love going thereto this day and I'll keep saying that every time I mention it. lol


February 12th we went fishing at Pulpit Rock Pond in Munson Mass. I probably have more pictures of this place and more stories from when we were kids there used to be a slide there there's a beach there still but it's not as big as it used to be it's overgrown. Here's a nice little pickerel I caught. thought ice fishing is more about taking turns when using tip-ups.

March we had a house party at a friend's house played some beer pong with Brian rubbing on me.



I'm pretty sure somebody put something in my drink. lol I remember that couch being super comfortable.



I raised the Holyoke Road race this year I remember it being brutal, my right knee would swell for absolutely no reason. Event was a blast my dad showed up this time, I need to add more pictures. I loved jugging these races there are thousands of nice people everywhere.


From left to right there's my brother, Frank, Me, Marc and Brian you can see me wearing that Green Lantern sweatshirt I got at Six Flags



March we also went to the East Longmeadow Parade and watched it from Laura's parent's house. These used to be huge events.





Saturday April 16th did the Westfield Wildwater Canoe Races this year I race with my brother and came in 3rd, and then I raced a second time with Laura before we got married and came in 8th place






In May I had my knee scanned and learned that I had a cyst and wanted to get it taken care of because I thought it would keep me from coming in 2nd place and all these races I was doing with my friends


I used to go fishing up the street when I lived on South Street. I believe it's the quabog river, obviously I'll get up there's a picture of a trout I believe I caught, unless it's another type of fish 


May This is the first year that we went to Rhode Island, to Newport. We saw the Newport tower. 




We stopped at purgatory chasm on the way back for the first time




Sometime after the canoe race, I decided to ask Laura to marry me. I remember having a lot of anxiety at the time so I‚Äôm sure this played a part in my decision to ask her to get married. I like I felt like maybe I‚Äôd lose her, I also felt like you‚Äôre supposed to get married. I don‚Äôt feel like I wanna get married now it‚Äôs 2025 As I write this, but I never say never. lol I should probably find a picture to fill in here but I took her to quabbin and we went for a long walk or on the edge of the water and that's where I decided to ask her




6-4 Still singing karaoke at Mingles, I can't remember when they started calling us the mingles boys band but I thought that was hilarious. We used to sing all the time. Put a song up for me and then everyone would follow up and vice versa and the dj would get mad saying that we can't do that as cheating.


6-17 Right shoulder orthoscopy surgery Dr Karas New England orthopedics

6-28 Here's a bat I caught in the attic, I released it outside but it didn't make it and it ended up passing away, I think it injured its wing.



7-7-11
7-7 Knee surgery Dr Corsetti New England orthopedics

Laura rented us a cabin at Fern Lake and the week of July 15th to the 17th

I had knee surgery in July and then while I was healing we rented a cabin at Fern Lake across the lake from my aunts and that's when I found that Barnard signed and took it home my brother and sister came up my mother came and left 'cause her boyfriends mother died agnes. That entire vacation I tried to row the boat while we fished, It made my back feel so much better. I don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt have a picture, but this place was awesome. It was an across the lake and further than my aunt‚Äòs cabin, So we had a view of white faced mountain. I also brought the telescope that Laura bought me, but there were not any good viewing conditionI was very disappointed. Usually, the sky up there it‚Äôs like the clearest you‚Äôve ever seen.

I feel like I was lucky to make it back from that trip. One of the rear tires on my car was out of alignment in the tire was worn down to the Wire. Also, while we are driving to the camp, I learned that you do not leave 5 gallon buckets laying inside of a boat while you‚Äôre towing it, The wind current caught one bucket and it flew like 70 feet into the air and off to the side of the road and I was going too fast and didn‚Äôt stop and grab it. Thankfully, it didn‚Äôt hit any other cars, but it‚Äôs not a very bright thing to do. 

While at Fern Lake, we found some driftwood and dragged that across the lake back to the camp. The boat look like it was struggling to stay afloat lol We found it in the area near a beach towards the east of Fern Lake, Right near where we are staying. The area that this Driftwood was in, I remember almost catching a bass when I was younger, I imagined it was a huge largemouth bass. I was using a jitterbug at the time and I was fishing with my dad and I thought for sure this thing was a monster, But he went on and on telling me oh no, it was probably small. Ever since then, I‚Äôve always loved using jitterbugs and they always remind me moment fishing with my dad. 

We drove over to my aunt‚Äôs old property while we were there in her camp was torn down, but her old sign was still on the tree out front. If it wasn‚Äôt for Laura wanting to rent a cabin there that I wouldn‚Äôt have this today. I hung the old Daredevil fishing lure there because all the old timers swore by this and said that pickerel loved them. As an adult I have had zero luck using these and they're just for decoration but every time I look at them I'm reminded of all those older people in my family that I used to go visit in New York. I guess it helps with all these people were positive influences in my life




Laura and I stopped at  AuSable Chasm in New York after, it was beautiful there. We went here as a family when we were children but I don't remember it.



2011 Agnes Soucy died 7-15 born 7-22-1928 married to Donat Soucy mother to Robert Soucy, grandmother to robert and eric soucy

After one of the surgeries I had this year Laura wanted to give blood at it blood drive and I felt fantastic after that I don't know what bloodletting does to me but it made my system feel better.

Picture of Frank and I at max cap September 30th, I'm pretty sure this was Derek and the fun bags playing that night


I started losing races there's a video of that

October 1 or 2nd I won my last race against anyone I competed with, and I did it by a kind of cheating. My knee had been bothering me for a year or two, and that entire race My brother and I, we kind of ran by the side-by-side. At the end of the race, he took off ahead of me and I‚Äôd really didn‚Äôt think I had anything in me, but then a certain song came on my Little Sony Shuffle I think it was and man did I start to feel pumped up. I waited for my brother to turn around to look to see how far back I was And as soon as he turned around and saw that I was a far enough away that he felt confident he was gonna win, I burst forward with everything I had and I ended up beating him by like a few inches. He caught onto what I was doing before we reached the finish line, but it was too late at that point. lol Just cause I‚Äôm injured doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to give up, especially if you give me a chance.

Laura and I got married on my birthday October 8th such a great idea lol Now I can think of my ex wife on my birthday every year. We also got married at Quabbin at the tower



There was a blizzard October 29th of this year and we drove I think it was a foxwoods or Mohegan's son to go see Anthony Jeselnik. We ended up driving under trees that were falling across the road, on the way home we had to drive over a tree. We saw a plow truck smashed into a tree that was down just and barrel through it. We were without power for a week



November Picture of Dom working out in the basement over in West Warren





 2012

 2012

January I signed up for Branford Hall started school, my body was failing me. I just got married previous October and I didn't ask my wife about signing up for school and I also don't think she was happy about it. I remember sitting in the back bedroom in West Warren looking out the window feeling like my life was going nowhere and I had no idea why. At the time, I didn‚Äôt understand that the system was designed to keep people down, I honestly believed that the system was supposed to help us and that we are all supposed to be there for each other. lol

After starting at Branford, just by coincidence one of my best friends, Eric started taking classes there as well. It shows the lack of communication ahead of the time that I didn‚Äôt tell anybody anything and no one had a clue what I was doing, and I didn‚Äôt know what they were doing either.

Medical assisting school was way too easy for me, But then when I started getting sick, I started having horrible anxiety and panic attacks. I remember one time in class this girl we used to call her potbelly Kelly. She was super disruptive in class, Probably exactly like I was a child lol

Unfortunately, one day I yelled at her because she was being really annoying, and I was having a lot of anxiety. She had looked on my phone and told another girl in class what was on it, And I yelled for her to mind her own business and told her how annoying she was. Which looking back was completely stupid because she was not disrupting any of the learning experience for me anyway. It was just my anxiety getting the best of me. And it was more of a cut the crap yelling at her, But honestly, looking back, I feel like a complete jerk, I‚Äôm sure it was totally embarrassing for her and I shouldn‚Äôt of done that.

March 16th we went to New York City laura and I and saw Joel Mchale.



Picture of Dominic and I at 5 mile pond in May, I love chasing down baby geese petting them and then letting them go lol



6-22 left wrist arthroscopy Dr Adler
 June 22rd I had arm surgery, for some reason after surgeries, we always went and did something, had tons of energy after surgery and this day I‚Äôm almost positive is was this surgery.  Laura Dom and I went to Quabbin Reservoir and that‚Äôs when we saw the baby porcupine on the path and it was leaping around. It was one of the cutest things I‚Äôve ever seen. I love baby animals. I remember waking up from the surgery because my doctor told me he was going to shorten the alma in my left forearm. But he wasn't able to do that because the ligaments in my left wrist were so bad that it took them almost two hours to stitch them back together. I remember him apologizing to me because things were much worse than the scans led him to believe. I'm going to hear this from a couple doctors I mean surgeons


You can see that I did not suffer from a lack of energy or a lack of motivation after having surgery



Took Dominic to Zot Park in Chicopee. I think all the tanks are fenced up


For anybody that likes to see what it looks like when someone has torn ligaments in their wrist repaired, they use buttons to hold things together.


Saturday April 21st did the Westfield Wildwater races canoes this year I only raced with my wife Laura We came in 6th place. There are no pictures because when I get sick and break up with people I just delete everything I don't know why I do stuff like that I think it's because of my anxiety


I moved back to Springfield with Laura to keep going to school because it was too hard to travel from Warren to Springfield for a medical assisting job. Honestly I don‚Äôt think I asked her opinion. I probably talked to her into moving back to Springfield. I can‚Äôt be sure if Laura had any issues with my behavior up until this point, She might‚Äôve been OK. After this, my behavior got much worse 


This is taken July 8th at Mary Lynch Field, I still have one of these foam planes, they don't sell them anymore. I love these things, ever since I was a kid I thought these were the greatest.




July 29th we went to Monster's trucks at Stafford Springs Motor Speedway





Laura and I took Dominic to Mike's maze I believe it's in Sunderland up near Mount Sugarloaf. Here's a picture of the two of them shooting the potato guns



Right now if you Dominic was in a Cub Scout parade at the Big E in West Springfield




Laura took classes at Goodwin College in Connecticut while I was at Branford Hall this year


That fall October or November I was injured at work, even though I had a cast on, jerks gave me harder jobs. I never got time off to heal. I should‚Äôve been really pissed at this, We all did specific jobs every day, The only time things would change were at the beginning and ends of rounds, so that‚Äôs what they called it. I used to reset fruit snacks, canned vegetables, canned fruits, The types of things you can handle with one hand. And by reset I mean, I would go into different western mass Big Y‚Äôs and change the set up for new food items coming in and for old items being discontinued to be removed. We would receive specific blueprints that would need to be followed. The catch with this job was you got paid for your entire shift no matter what, so the faster you worked, the faster you got to go home. Then to be a jerk the manager for my team gave me bulk juice boxes, when you could clearly see that I was only using one hand work and had a full cast on. lol Honestly, I think if I didn‚Äôt have the genetic issues that I have I would‚Äôve been fine doing that set. I was that buff at the time. lol

 
Took Dominic ice skating at Forest Park, that year they are giving out monster trucks to all the kids. I love skating at a few of these local places because we went to them as kids and it just brings back happy memories. Love the fact that I'm sharing my memories with the future generation.




2013 More Trouble on the Horizon

 2013

Decided to get creative making Dominic's Pinewood Derby car this year. I've always loved back to the future and thought I would see what I could do with a Dremel












2013 1-16 That's when that Walmart accident happened please help that girl who was driving without car insurance and had the rejection sticker for safety. My fight with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts


January 21 Even though I was injured I took Dominic to enter skate it was not as enjoyable as I would have liked. My little kids don't understand the adults could hurt so I didn't want him to miss out.



These pinewood derby races were a lot of fun we got to drive to Pittsfield to some mall that was like 75% empty. 


I've got this running theme with the second place what the heck lol









This goes all the way back to 1994 when my friend Tammy Lynds went missing. Right now acting Springfield police superintendent is someone i know from my past, Larry Akers was one of my soccer coaches during the period that Tammy went missing in 1994, i believe he was a detective at the time. His son also played on my soccer team. I ran into Akers again in 2013 he looked like he was a patrol officer then, this was while trying to file a complaint against his fellow officers for denying me medical attention. I had asked him about my friend Tammy at this time and he had no answers and I asked him if I was ever really a suspect and he said no and by the way he responded I honestly believed him.

Februar 28 Went back to court with Sheldon's statement and the security guard. I Don't know why the district attorney's office didn't want to get statements from witnesses or people at the scene to describe what they saw



March 7th I went down to the Springfield Police Department civilian complaint department and filed a complaint I was told that was supposed to be run by civilians but I spoke to a sergeant every time I went there. I already knew my medical results at this point.I handed them a copy of my notorized 

statement, a copy of sheldons statement and a copy of the walmart security 

statement. I didn't tell the officers i already got my medical results back,

i wanted them to acknowledge it on their on. i signed a medical authorization form

 and gave those officers the names of my surgeons and primary care drs. 

March 22 court made me wait around until i signed saying i didn't want a lawyer

4-15 I went to go watch the Boston Marathon my brother was running the race I had wanted to but I felt physically horrible I was barely holding it together and I got some pictures that way I thought were absolutely crazy. When the first bomb went off I thought it was just fireworks that's what it smelled like anyways and we are about 100 feet away I believe when the second bomb went off that's when the panic started we were by Uno's pizzeria so we were able to kind of hide behind a little brick wall and I was able to watch everybody fleeing and panic it was terrifying, the police had no clue what was going on.










It's horrifying but in the first pictures I took I caught one of the bombers with one of the backpack bombs, you can see in the 4th picture the smoke from the first bomb and part of the Uno sign where we were standing

April learn about nerve damage from dr adler.

May 1 Trial day- 5-1-2013
fight for color copies of pictures after





May 10 back to stupidity

Hired that scumbag lawyer Randy Milo and his partner Eric Applebaum to help with my case and then Randy filed the motion to withdraw because he said he didn't know how to handle these types of cases and I needed to find a different lawyer. I tried to ask Eric Applebaum about this and he was confused as well

May 20th graduated Branford Hall, I was supposed to get a job volunteering at Bay State Medical Center but because of my felony I was no longer allowed to volunteer anywhere and I was devastated by this.



June 5 got complaint response- was devastated 

June- Call police chief William Fitchet And spoke with him on the phone for like 45 minutes and I thought that he had brain damage. I asked him everyone I could report being denied medical attention to and for having that insurance information deleted off of my police report

August 8 went to complaint department- same dick head

I reported what happened to my probation officer Janet Ely about the lack of insurance and police officers denying me medical attention and officers at the Civilian Department tampering with my complaint form she told judge hadley in a backroom meeting.


August 9  took Dominic hiking at Mount Tom and we collected Newtons in the road and maybe toads as we walked I thought this was one of their coolest things ever.




11-7 I ran into the security guard and when he told me what he did I was super excited and asked him to write another statement and I provided that statement to the district attorney's office and those pathetic folk in losers didn't do a thing



2013 Stcc 2013-2014 classes with LK I'll have to look I took a psychology course and another English course I don't I can't remember now

At this time I was super excited I had contacted channel three news by email and I spoke to a guide downtown at their station and I drove to 22 news and spoke with someone a gentleman at the outside there building and these guys seemed super excited about the stories I was telling them and then I never heard back from these guys again, I gave them all the evidence I had at the time as well

8-20-2013 I had a worker's comp meeting with the Department of industrial accidents this morning before I had to show up in court. I reported what was going on to the insurance company , my workers comp lawyer, to the Department of industrial accidents and they had no idea who to report these types of crimes to. Judge Hadley had that backroom conversation with Janet Eli and I was disgusted I didn't know how this could be allowed. Judge Hadley also said that he could not read this evidence unless Ada was present but he read the evidence and then said that which is pretty stupid but whatever.

In September I had surgery for the torn rotator cuff from my accident at Walmart and it got infected.

My shoulder got infected in September and I was forced to still go to that fake anger management class. I went to the emergency room after that class and was stuck in the hospital for a week. I remember it well because that's when Paul Walker had died and that's all we did in anger management let's talk about the news and goof around it was pathetic.
Started ice skating after my surgery even though my shoulder was wide open I felt way better I don't know if it was the ivy antibiotics or all of the iv fluids flushing through my system but something made me feel better and doctors didn't believe me.

Here's a gross picture of the wound I was sent home with I got a bunch more pictures to add to


At some point, I had a colonoscopy To figure out what was wrong with me


I tried to do probation through the Hampton County court system but they had us going to the Swift River Sportsman's club and cleaning up brush so that a member of the probation department I believe that lived there could have an easier time hunting

Took some classes the fall at Springfield Technical Community College I can't remember I believe that I took Spanish at this time with Laura I also took a psychology and anthropology class two separate classes but I don't I think those are in 2014



 2014 Learning the System

 2014 

Completed the fake anger management class they sent me to in January. Waste of my life what a sick joke that these people play on citizens.
In February 7 I file a harassment order against that driver Kishana because she kept driving by my house and I thought that she was stalking me. I was supposed to return on the 20th but someone in the courthouse had the case changed to the 12th. 2-12-2014
amazing that I was attacked on the same street that someone in my case 
lived on but I wouldn't find out about that until sept 4, 2014.
what did police do with the video from the day of my attack? 
I talked to the Manager Roger from napa and he confirmed that officers came and picked it up and he was 
able to see the black SUV involved in my attack and he confirmed people entering 
and exiting that vehicle that was waiting for me up near Boston rd.
I wonder if it also showed someone driving illegally who lived on that street,
just a couple houses away headed to court after my attack?
IT'S A 2 MINUTE WALK from my house TO THIS PERSONS HOUSE, 463FT ACCORDING TO GOOGLE MAPS.

February 12th I was attacked on my way to court a vehicle that was parked across the street from what I would learn to be is this Shana's apartment drove up the street two men jumped out attacked me and then the vehicle drove off it was a snowy day I had no idea what happened and when I got to court everyone at court acted stupid on purpose and never investigated. I have a copy of that please report
















February 28th back to court for stupidity One up for Judge Hadley or ADA Johnston acted really stupid like this I would go back home super frustrated and that ruined my relationship with my wife


March 20th 2014 we had the Pinewood Derby for Dominick's Cub Scouts
This year I carved Dom a shark-shaped pinewood derby car. I tried to put a gig figure on the back of it but it weighed too much. I decided to go with the shark design since he loved that we fought in the pool with so much







March 28th ish I had ankle surgery to repair the damage done from one that uninsured driver hit me and her tire stopped on my car





May 19, 2014 

May 19th I heard from the Massachusetts ombudsman and she informed me that yes those officers did access that driver's registration information and they knew she was driving illegally without car insurance. Talking to this woman drove me nuts because she told me the truth and told me that I couldn't do anything with it there's nothing she could do. No one to report any of this too. Telling me the moon is in the sky so what what are you going to do about it.

may 20-2014 

over the phone i was made aware that my file was found and 

my judgement was already in the mail. how do files go missing?
5-21

discovered so much evidence altered it was nuts

5-27-2014 
Judge Boyle Ignored evidence i provided the court

I'd provided the police report, my unaltered notarized statement and the altered version, the fake receipt I found inside the court docket, the actual receipt I got from the window place, copies of my medical records, and the complaint from the civilian department, copies of this girls lack of insurance. I was dismissed before I could speak.

5-29-2014


after a ridiculous amount of effort, i was able to get a registry employee

to help get me legal copies of a registration/title inquiry without a court order.

through this information i was able to confirm that Springfield police officers did in fact delete information 

from their reports. An R5 from the MA state troopers shows both police print outs have 

been altered by different Springfield police officers at different times for different reasons.

i did this because i felt judge Hadley was trying to withhold information from me,  i

wanted to prove how hard it was to obtain information and to prove i wasn't a liar. I felt so sick at this time and I felt like I had something to prove. Even if the insurance company somehow didn't set up an alert for those police officers, the sticker for safety and the missing front plate and the registration was suspended should have set things off as well
6-3-2014

ADA katharine Johnston 


what happened to the original copy of the court order for the video 
from Walmart that ADA Johnston had?? She only gave me a copy that i gave to Walmart.
ADA Johnston also had originals of my statement that was notarized
and Sheldon's statement. she only had a copy of the security guard 
statement, because he gave me a copy and kept the original at Walmart.


reminder: I was able to obtain the original statement from Walmart security after i 
was reminded it existed by the report i got from police 
investigating my complaint against officers Thomas Sheehan and Thomas Douglas.
i then went back to Walmart for a copy and he handed it to me.

6-13-2014
Then I went to the window place to see how this driver paid for our window since she didn't have car insurance, that's when i learned ada Johnston lied about the window being paid for.
The owner of the window shop wasn't gonna give me a copy of the receipt to return to court because he didn't believe anyone was ever going to pay for it, so I paid for it and brought a copy back to court. I never asked the owner how much the receipt was I simply offered to pay for it he said okay and I went by what the court had told me it was and I had previously paid to the court. It wasn't until I got to court that I noticed that the prices were different and that the original unaltered price was $245, less then the 311 claimed. I went back to the window shop and accused the owner of changing the price and he became furious with me and demanded that I leave. I said I was going to call the cops and report what he did. And he said I never asked him what the price was I just said I would pay for it and I ran off and then I came back with a money order. He told my better leave right now and then he prays I get some help. I asked him well why is the price different, and he said he didn't know he said that the $245 was the price that he faxed to the insurance company and that the driver never returned to pay for her window when it came back that she did not have insurance. He said another woman came and asked for a copy of the receipt and said she needed it for court and she never came back and paid for the window either. I'm lucky that guy didn't knock me out he was way bigger than I was and he looked like he was pissed and I was rude and disrespectful and I don't know, I have no excuse for my behavior I was sick at the time so it was my fault i jumped to conclusions without asking him. thankfully I got him to write that statement before I pissed him off. lol
6-13-2014 after people ignoring me at the courts, i went to the state police and asked for their help. they gave me papers but didn't know what to do or who to contact. They didn't know why the R5 the officer that the complaint department gave me didn't have her rejection sticker information on it. it should have been there.

June 16th we want fishing in Hamden, up the street from the rec where we used to have our family picnics, that river was pretty awesome, there's a vfw there that has an anti aircraft gun seeing that stuff always gets me excited reminds me of being a kid. This is the same river that runs behind the nursing home that my grandmother passed away in grandma Francis.

6-22 We went hiking with my cousin James Laura and I up Monument Mountain and we want to bash Bish Falls. I need to add more details



2014-6-20


sent conflict of interest, i was told because judge Hadley is friends with members

of Kishana family, they don't want there to appear to be any conflicts of interest.

her cousin works in the clerks office, sister works with the district attorneys 

office in some capacity. In the beginning I thought this case was because I caught somebody tampering with my statement. I had no idea it was about a phony court order at first. Seeing that my statement was notarized.

2014-7-9

when i first learned of this forgery charge, i was super excited.

i thought the courts were going to do something about my altered 

notarized statement with the forged electronic signature. When I met my first attorney Nolan he was super excited and thought this case was a slam dunk 


August 
Here‚Äôs another fracked up time. I need to write about this. So back after I got hit by that phone I learned that my wife at the time Laura her mother worked with a girl at a point in time and that girl was fired from her company. Laura‚Äôs mother worked for MHA the mental health association in Springfield mass and they dealt with people with disabilities. And I was furious when I found out that this girl got fired from that company. I was sick at the time so I was really stupid. I yelled at Laura and I wanted her mother to write a letter why that girl is fired because I thought she was a disgusting person. I took all of the anger and rage. I felt at the courts and made my wife feel like a piece of shat and she did absolutely nothing wrong. I just unleashed myself upon her like a complete fracking a-hole and I remember all of it. I remember how I feel like such a piece of fracking shat now but at the time I had shat tons of anxiety and I felt like people were hiding stuff from me. lol  I mean they were but it wasn‚Äôt Laura or her family. 

2014-9-9
Kishana is able to get a harassment order against me.
once i found out she lived up the street, i had contacted the 
Springfield police to report her lying about her address and 
using a fake address for her insurance and excise tax.
they told me to go frack myself.

Sept 15 nagged Sheldon for statement

2014-10-1

i tried once again to report the illegal activity i found going on.

courts denied my attempts at showing what i found.

i also noticed the signatures on the harassment order and those

 auto glass receipts were different, so i went to court and paid

 for a copy of the check they mailed Kishana, so i could get a better 
look at her signature

I remember going to see my uncle Dave in the hospital and talking with a family. Close with these people they don't like the way I talk or how open I am. Remember telling them telling me that my father was supposed to come back and play some music for my uncle while he was dying. Was really drugged up and he couldn't speak at all or open his eyes you could just hear him struggling to breathe when you were talking to him like he was getting emotional and wanted to wake up but he wasn't too much pain and couldn't.

I remember standing in the backyard and Warren telling my father how much it would have been to his brother if he went there and played the guitar one last time because they used to play in a little band together. I kept telling everybody about this, In the end my dad and his best friend Rick Moran did go to the hospital and played the guitar for my uncle Dave and they said that they saw tears in his eyes. And that makes me want to cry and it makes me happy at the same time it's sad that he was dying but happy that his brother was there in the end doing something that they loved together.


Uncle Dave passed away on November 22nd 2014 12th

Psychiatry Note E&M
Persons Present: Dr. and patient
Chief Complaint: I think the Depakote made me more anxious when I started I think the Depakote
may be reducing my sperm count
Interval HPI: Patient is very obsessive about his sperm count he's actually bought a
microscope and he and his wife look at it underneath the microscope and they
don't see any sperm. Patient is suicidal almost every day has no active plan and
he's not actively suicidal spend this way for years he had a couple of attempts
years ago he thinks of his family now and this stops him from killing himself.
Patient is not homicidal patient lives with his wife
patient had a vasectomy and 04 he does not want children
patient states he's been married three or four years he has three previous
children he is a strange from them he doesn't have to pay child support they are
with a different woman. Again patient is not want children he had avast ectomy
patient states when he married his current wife she said she didn't care about
having children or didn't want them but now that is changed patient feels
tremendous pressure to have children he is generally in denial of all this intends
to focus on the meds is giving him sexual side effects or he gets an erection and
then it goes away and then it comes back and also that it's reducing his sperm
count patient is not full-blown delusional on this but is profoundly anxious about
this.
Patient states that he doesn't think the meds are doing much of anything he
sleeping 8 to 10 hours he states he gets suicidal but before that his heart is
pounding his he has anxiety and before that he starts to obsess about things.
Patient generally obsesses and worries about the fact that he had a car accident
three or four years ago he was walking in a parking lot in a girl without insurance
backed up and hit him and somehow he punched his elbow through the
windshield the police charged him with malicious attacking of a vehicle patient
has no clear insight as to what the real clear events were but he's feeling
completely victimized by this he goes back to court and he has court now delayed
till September he's trying to get this removed from his record. Patient states he
needs to get her remove city can get a job he's at various job staying a year to
generally quits her leaves can really hold work states in high school used to get
straight F's and then at the end of the term of the semester he would work really
hard and get all a so he can end up with the sea for the class he used to like to
play practical jokes he denies psychotic symptoms believes he was on Ritalin as
a child

Impression/Plan
Impression: Patient is extremely ruminative and obsessive he denies specific features of OCD
but his thinking is in this realm. Patient give some history of some manic type
features it's he has no insight into his illness and he somewhat of a vague
historian as he is so ruminative however he's obsessive about this accident and
there is a question of possibly some self-destructive behavior by accidents and
injuries he's at his also had a couple of suicide attempts and previously he's gone
for a month on an hour of sleep years ago his suicide attempts were years ago
he's chronically suicidal no active plans typically starts with rumination used to
have more anger now it's anxiety leading to a chest discomfort and racing heart
which leads to the suicidal thinking there is racing thoughts he complains of
which are consistent with bipolar but also ruminative thoughts which are very
obsessive.
Problems/Plans: (Include information about problem status, interventions)
1. Contracts for safety no need for hospitalization can stay safe
2. has a medical marijuana card states it doesn't help stop using marijuana
patient agrees
3. Stop using alcohol patient is drinking about once or twice a month patient
agrees to stop
4. Needs a psychotherapist recommend a male therapist at this time unclear
right patient wasn't set with another one or referred spoke with Melissa the
medical assistant who will send for referral to try to get this patient was
psychotherapy med management is improper and I will be of very little utility
without good ongoing psychotherapy for this patient certainly patient needs to
work on issues of the pressure he's up against a have children as well as thought
stopping in the rumination that he does leading to his anxiety to suicidality
5. increase Zyprexa he's been on 30 at bedtime will go to 40 and will do Zyprexa
20 mg BID to cover and compensate for the change of going off the depakote
6. d/c Depakote patient hates it believes it six acting as our believes when he
started his made his anxiety worse he states that was planned with Regina

Richards to work off of this it's unlikely it's affecting his sperm are is erectile
dysfunction what is a bit risky leave this could lead to more manic behavior will
adjust the other medications
7. Change lithium to 600 mg B this may give better benefit of the over the course
of the day instead of 1200 at night, reviewed this patient
8. Discontinue cogentin patient states the olanazpine never really gave him side
effects he believes when he started the Depakote it was making him more
anxious
9. Start Zoloft 25 mg PO Q a.m. explained target side effects discussed the
sexual side effect issue in depth with patient again believe this is multifactorial
patient needs to work on this in depth in psychotherapy. This will be for the
ruminative obsessive anxiety and thinking again increase in the zyprexa and
balancing out the lithium will hopefully cover for any manic episodes we have
discontinued the Depakote but patient should have a reasonable coverage with
the increase in zyprexa and the changing of the lithium schedule

 2015 Another Collapse

In the summer before I actually tried to kill myself I did go to Baystate and I went to the emergency room and they let me go the same night they didn't even keep me or do any blood work. At baystate in Springfield my ex-wife had brought me



Attorneys John Nolan and Elaine Pourinski both agreed that my evidence was
more than enough to clear my name of any wrong doing. attorney Nolan had to excuse himself
 because of his friendship with ADA Katherine Johnston and it being a case she was involved in.
Attorney Pourinski even had an investigator corroborate everything I'd said in my previous statements in a 2015 meeting.
he even questioned me as to why i paid for the window, while we were all in her office. 
I told them that on 5-19-2014 Edward Kavari told me since the shop manager won't give me copies or write a statement, 
about the window( because he was worried he'd never get paid for it), he suggested that i should pay for it, 
then no one can argue restitution, because there is none. i also told ADA Kavari about the ombudsman Judy saying
that i can call while in the court room and she'll just tell Judge Hadley himself that Kishana's r5 was accessed  
1-16-2013 at 2:49 and she can name the officer, that way i won't break any privacy 
laws, even though there's nothing private about it. it's just an officer name a time and a license plate number.
I never got to talk to Mr Kavari after i was able to save enough to pay for the
 window, i wasn't able to inform Kavari or ADA Johnston when i returned to court on 6-13-2014 when i was finally 
able to afford what i thought was $311.51, that the receipt was also a fake.
the investigator was able to confirm that $245.94 was the amount submitted to the insurance company.
The investigator even confirmed that i went back to the window repair company and annoyed the 
manager after discovering the fake receipt and different total. ( at this point i was unaware of the fake court order, 
and even when i first received the forgery court date, i thought it was because i found out someone altered my 
notarized statement deleting pages and electronically forging my signature. so i kept looking for more evidence to prove
Kishana and the officers were hiding something. i reported my statement being altered to John Gay 5-22-2014, my 
file had been missing for some time at this point, i kept trying to get audio of judge Hadley telling
 me my jury had been sent home by accident,
so i was regularly calling the court house and asking Paul in the office if he had any luck finding  that part of the audio
 from the day of my trial or if judge Hadley's ruling had come back on my motion for new trial)
 I went down to the court house 6-13-2014 after paying for the window with all the paperwork 
the manager gave me and a statement he wrote stating Kishana never returned to pay for the 
window and didn't have insurance at the time of the accident. 
I tried to talk to ADA Edward Kavari or Katherine Johnston, I wanted to show 
someone in the ADA's office what i had found, but they both unavailable. 
this time while i was there, I was able to obtain a photo of the original receipt, someone in the office finally 
let me see physically the receipt on the counter ( instead of just telling me about it as had been the case for a year),
but they still didn't feel safe giving me a physical copy.  
In the photo you can see the fake receipt has a red paid for stamp and a date. at this point i know everyone at the court house heard
me run my mouth as to what i had discovered. so of course i 
wanted to know why the amount on the receipt the auto glass guy gave me and the one that ADA Katherine presented to
 Judge Hadley was different than the one i had just paid for. 
so I went back the net day because the manager wasn't in the shop when i drove by.
Needless to say, i probably didn't sound very polite when i asked why he gave Kishana a paid for receipt
if she didn't pay for it, i wanted to know why he increased the amount of her receipt and . I'm pretty sure
this is where i wore out my welcome. the Auto glass guy said he never gave me a price, i only asked if she
paid for it and if i could pay for it and then ran off after i paid for it before he could say anything. 
he told me he already deposited it and aske me to leave. i tried to get him to write another statement and
he kindly told me he was a religious man and thought i needed to let this go. that was the last i spoke with him


The investigator even confirmed no one went back to the window company to ask about or pay for the window
 after i reported it down at the court house.


i believe those superior court judges, their prosecutor and my appointment attorney Elaine Pourinski
showed depraved indifference to my plight.
they all took advantage of the fact that i was in and out of the hospital for multiple suicide attempts.

My health took a turn for the worst the end of sept 2015, i started to grow breasts from the medication i was given
by drs, i still hadn't been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism at this point. i was taking medication for issues i was 
misdiagnosed with, then i spent time in the psych ward for a suicide attempt from cutting myself.

during this rough time my attorney Elaine Pourinski said the prosecutor made an offer of a cwof and that if i accept
 this, my previous guilty finding would be changed to a cwof as well and since it was over a year, would 
automatically be off my record. but i had to agree not to present the window receipt against Kishana 
and not to pursue any civil actions against any officers involved. i agreed due to my health issues.
December 2015 i again suffered some sort of nervous breakdown for no reason and attempted suicide again by swallowing
hundred upon hundreds of all the depression/bipolar medication i was prescribed. i have very little memory of 
my time in the psych ward this time,  next thing i remember it's Christmas eve and I'm no longer in the psych ward.


12 days later Jan 5-2016 rolls around and the judge doesn't agree to the terms of the cwof.
  
i still wanted to fight the charge and was still willing, then Jan 19-2016 i suffer another 
mental break down for no apparent reason. i can recall putting a bed against the door and then trying 
to strangle myself with a sheet wrapped twisted around my neck as tight as i could 
get it, i leave the psych ward Jan 25-2016, i had another meeting with my
attorney elaine Pourinski before my trial date of Feb. 5-2016 11 days later. before this meeting, in the hallway 
outside her office in Northampton, an older white male placed a hammerless revolver to my forehead and warned me
not to move forward with my evidence. i was told to plead guilty.
I informed my attorney after the incident and she said there was nothing she could do to help me, i was
 still stubborn and wanted to fight the charges and she kept telling me how afraid she was not 
just for herself and her family, but for my safety and my families.
i didn't want to plead guilty, i was made to feel i had to plead guilty, that i didn't have a 
choice. i was told by my attorney the first judge knew about the fake receipt Kishana supposedly
 produced and about the police tampering with their reports,
which the state police also proved for me. i felt so sick and didn't have anything in me after this last psych 
ward stay, less than 2 weeks earlier and with the thought of having that gun to my head so fresh in my sick mind. 
i plead guilty.
come to find out, i had undiagnosed hyperthyroidism all my life. blood test from jan 2016 -march 2016 can confirm
even when i tried to kill myself back in 2005 can be tied to 
an episode of severe reaction to hyperthyroidism and a past blood test that was over looked proves it.
 since i was on workers comp at the time of the accident and 
for a short time after my first trial 2013,
i was able to get a closed period disability payment for the time that i called to sign up for, this was right after i got 
off of workers comp.

then i discovered the reason for officers Sheehan's comment about my tightening up while being arrested,
after being forced to stand around for over half hour in the cold with improper attire. 
turns out i have a untreatable, incurable genetic skeletal muscle disorder, not only was i right about having a problem,
it was even worse than i could've imagined.
i tried to keep working after that, but kept needing surgeries and couldn't take time off,  i had to work with casts on.
i got sick physically from all of that and filed for permanent disability and wasn't even allowed to complain about all my issues and they
cold kill me, before the judge stopped me and told me not to worry about it and i would be getting permanent disability.

September noticed breast tissue forming 


I started working again for advantage in September or October while I was dealing with this court stuff. And yet stressed me out so much that that's when I tried to commit suicide for the first time in October. 

Barely holding it together, dad said monkey could do my job while we were talking in his kitchen. I felt lucky to even have a job and felt super low energy

I tried to commit suicide again in December and this time the doctors just released me and didn't even keep me for the full three days that they were required by law and I'm pretty sure I don't know I have to check my blood work they might have known I had hyperthyroidism then

2016

January 2016 I drank some rat poison and attempted to commit suicide again an ambulance brought me to the Palmer emergency room. Escaped and made it back to Warren. Warren police officers came and brought me back to the emergency room and on that drive we talked about their dashcam and in vehicle recording system that they had gotten. I told that officer how Springfield police officers denied me medical attention and I caught ADA Johnston providing a fake receipt to the courts all because that driver did not have car insurance and she was driving with a suspended registration and had a rejection sticker for safety. I told that officer that this driver had a sister in the district attorney's office and had friends that were police officers

At some point getting out of the psych ward January 25 and being forced and depleting guilty February 5. I was went to a scheduled for a meeting at my lawyer, Elaine Pourinski‚Äôs office in Northampton And when I showed up, a man and older gentleman pulled out of small hammerless revolver, and placed it to my forehead and took the files that Elaine Pourinski had asked me to bring that day. He told me not to pursue this case and I was a complete disaster and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. When I walked into Elaine Pourinskis office, I was a complete wreck and she told me there‚Äôs nothing she can do and she doesn‚Äôt want me calling the cops, She told me she‚Äôs having knee surgery and she‚Äôs worried for her safety and Her family safety. I thought obligated to stay quiet, Plus, I felt like a complete disaster because I was so sick at the time and barely holding it together as it was. Obviously, looking back I know this is a complete setup and she was just playing stupid because she knew I was sick. All these court appointed lawyers are scum and I‚Äôm gonna prove it. I‚Äôve got years worth of data to track.

 March

I don't know why there's not more information here my marriage with Laura dissolved I was March it was pretty rough I was a disaster after losing that court case since I'm sure she couldn't deal with my nonsense anymore and I didn't even know what my nonsense was all about.
Our breakup was terrible she wanted to keep Harley and there was no way in hell I was going to let that happen. When I was in the Psych Ward she knew my father said that we could not have a dog his rules said no. And she talked me into agreeing to get a puppy while I was in the psych ward anyway and showed me a video which I'm going to place online and add to this

Saturday April 16th did the Westfield Wildwater Canoe races this year I erased with my brother we came in second place and a bunch of his friends raced as well


May 22nd we went to the coolest World War Two reenactment event I've ever seen in my entire life. I took Dominick one of my brother and his kids.




Sept 2015, I had developed breast tissue and had to have it removed. It was quite embarrassing from all the drugs that those doctors were pumping me up Misdiagnosis

Dominic played soccer this year, I think that was the last year that he played as well.

July 3rd my mother sent me a goofy picture of Harley jumping on dominic's dog's Bugsy's back


I took Dominic fishing in the Chicopee River underneath the bridge between Wilbraham and Ludlow. I have fond memories of going there as a child we caught a pickerel that had a wound on its side. i'll have to tell that story later.


September 2016 Tammy's sister Allison reached out to me September 4th I hadn't talked to her in 25 years since before her sister died. I tried to tell her everything I could remember but I was really sick at the time and when I went back and read my messages I realized that I told her some things that were wrong. The police had twisted some of my words and I don't know why I told her what they wanted me to say.





Took Dominic over my dad's September 5th for a family get together even though I had moved out at the beginning of the year I still kept trying to work on everyone's relationship














 met Beth on plenty of fish a dating site and we  went to see suicide squad at the Hadley movies theater at the Hampshire mall and then got chicken wings and talked at Arizona pizza after for a few couple hours. I told Beth My life story, the issues I had with my children‚Äôs mothers, the issues I had in the Coast Guard, my suicide attempts, and my troubles with the courts.

She told me all about the abuse her son suffered in a group home near fall, How the state of Massachusetts place their son as far away as possible, and did nothing to help him when he was assaulted, she only discovered her son was injured when her and her husband daughter arrived for a surprise visit around Halloween in 2015 and discovered that he was bleeding from his ear and they called 911 and he was brought to the emergency room, It was discovered that someone slapped him across the side of the head and blew out his eardrum. The company that he was staying with, tried to cover it up and bleach the room before police rrived. Beth tried to take her son home after that to care for him, but he had suffered too much PTSD, and she was forced to allow the state to take him and place him in the psych ward in New Hampshire, two hours away,And that ruined her marriage with her husband, and since my marriage was Destroyed for my court issues as well, that‚Äôs how we were able to meet. Both of us were screwed by the state and it ruined both of our marriages.


After that, the next day, we met up and went to the bridge of flowers in Shelburne Falls mass and took a ride, hoping to see a sunset overlooking north Adams, but we didn‚Äôt have any luck. 


After that, we became inseparable we hung around all the time I believe we went to visit her son in the psych ward the very first week we met. I think it was just three days later or four days later. 


    New Hampshire psych ward: Hampstead Hospital
    Beth‚Äôs son was placed 2 hours away even though there were closer options. You explained how doctors and state workers lied, sedated him, and even threatened to accuse Beth of abandonment to coerce her into unsafe placements .


Nice I‚Äôm glad my Ai caught that cause I‚Äôm gonna talk about stuff like this. You put in parentheses Beth made me drive. I wrote that when I was sick, I didn‚Äôt feel that way when I was healthy. I used to love driving. We used to talk all the time. When I was in the passenger seat, I had tend to see to play on my phone and stare out the window and not pay attention. But when I was driving, I would pay more attention and be in the moment.

    We moved in with my dad in West Warren on South Street and shortly after moving in her daughter wanted to move in with her father. She was having trouble at school and I didn‚Äôt want her trouble interfering with my legal issues so we agreed if she moved out, she wasn‚Äôt gonna be allowed to come back and have her way and tell us what to do, So Beth didn‚Äôt speak to her daughter for a couple years.


        Crystal Springs:
        You detailed the overmedication, denial of home visits, and repeated broken promises from staff like Rich Mancini, who lied about mall outings, activities, and even threatened ER placement when you resisted the use of ‚Äútime-out closets‚Äù

2019

I saw that a local blogger Lou Rock was making videos about Tammy so I wrote him April first 2019 I ended up meeting with him and he showed me where that pit was on Fox Road that I've never seen before. I made him some drone videos that he added to his videos of Tammy. I invited him over the house on Hope Street to show him what the house look like in the basement and why I thought it was a dumb idea that people come saying she crawled through my window and there was no evidence to support that. You can see all the plants outside of my window there's wild even before the middle of summer


April 11- Made drone videos for Lou Rock, I really thought that'd help it out

https://youtu.be/9fkIK7epo2M

September 2019 Beth had allowed me to collect quite a collection of toys while I was having all these surgeries, I also practice making stop motion at this time since it allowed me to work at my own pace









Harley in September. She‚Äôs so lazy. lol


October 6 Reptile show New Hampshire, Madame Sherri Forest Stone stair case. This was a rough trip, A lot of the trips with Beth were always rough. She always felt guilty that her son was being left behind and that we are taking my nephew to do all these exciting things. I don‚Äôt blame her for being upset but at the same time I need to live my life and I can‚Äôt drive four hours to go pick somebody up round-trip so I can go drive to another show. That‚Äôs a four hour round-trip and then have to drop somebody else off again And make another four hour trip. This is too much.

November 2 Rhode Island Comic-Con- This was one of the coolest comic cons I ever went to, I got to hang out with Ethan Peck for over 1/2 hour total talking about all kinds of cool stuff and how Patrick Stewart was the sexiest man alive and how he has a lot to live up to. This was before Star Trek Strange New Worlds came out so he wasn't as popular, so I thought this was awesome.

August - baby bird, Sue's son and family stay next door while i was sick, tried to talk. When Sue's son arrived, I tried to talk to him in the basement and he wasn't interested in learning what was going on. I really wonder if I could have figured things out if someone would have sat down and talked with me, instead of others always ignoring all the problems that were going on around us. I think the worst part is Adam works for NASA, I thought this kid was intelligent you would have thought he would have tried to figure out every single problem that was placed in front of him. lol Especially if someone has a problem with your mother, wouldn't you like to understand what was going on. Unless he already knew and didn't want to admit it. lol

It didn't help that the first night they arrived sue had piled up chairs in front of my door so we couldn't get into our apartment and then one of her son's dogs barreled towards us and because Harley's leash was attached the wrong way it snapped off and she could have been crushed. I was sick at the time so I felt like the situation was far worse than it might have been. Perception is 9/10 reality so it doesn't really matter what other people think, it only matters what you think in that moment and unfortunately I was sick and I felt like that whole situation was terrible I thought Harley was going to die. I'll have to get into this more

Notes: this is audio from one Beth went to get the restraining order after calling police and lying about my elbowing her in the face.


October 14, 2021 restraining order audio that I posted on YouTube shows Beth lying or you can hear Beth lying saying that my father said she could have our apartment and I wasn‚Äôt allowed back to the house

2021 I encouraged Beth to get back in touch with her daughter and reconnect. Part of that was taking her son and daughter to purgatory camWhich was a big rock place is a big rock place near where his Group home was Beth‚Äôs mother and stepfather met her and her daughter their and surprised them, they knew their was lack of communication in the fsmily, but didn‚Äôt use positive encouragement to solve issues. They were much older, Beth is also 6 years older than I am, so they‚Äôre  elderly, they all had a great time. Beth‚Äôs autistic son also encouraged his younger sister to climb a steep rock that day and it was documented on video, showing that autistic people have feeling and can encourage others too. He told his sister come on you can do it and he‚Äôs not a verbal kid. He doesn‚Äôt talk a lot. And not in coherent sentences like that, it was awesome.

Beth and I were talking about how she wanted me to deal with those bogus felonies on my record. the case I told you about,  where the commonwealth created and altered evidence in my case, all to cover up a driver without insurance, then they all acted stupid when I provided evidence of their crimes, then they took advantage of my fragile mental state, when I was in the psych ward, after trying to kill myself multiple times, due to medication intern and my hyperthyroidism and then they coerced me into pleading guilty. 
>
> Beth wanted me to be co-guardian of her son Stephen. I helped her in ways no one ever had before. 
> Dealing with the commonwealth was overwhelming for Beth. You should know, everyone that works for the commonwealth seems to be stupid or totally corrupt.
> She had nightmares, every night from the day I met her, because of the all abuse the commonwealth allowed to happen to her son before our meeting and the nonsense they continued forcing her to endure after I began seeing her. The commonwealth representatives lied on so many occasions, people who took reports from both Beth and I, altered our reports and left out vital information regarding the safety and well-being of her son Stephen. All to cover up this abuse and there‚Äôs pictures to prove it all. 
>
> Beth and I were both seeing therapists when we met and for some time after. 
> I spoke with my therapists about all the abuse Beth and her son endured. I know there‚Äôs a record about how Beth was struggling to deal with it all. 
> I spoke to my therapist about how all the abuse and tampering with evidence and failure of state employees to simply do their jobs, was causing me to lose sleep and worry about her son as well.  
>
> There‚Äôs also the emails, I don‚Äôt know how mine got deleted, there are all the emails that I wrote and sent out on Beth  and Stephens behalf.
> Stephen received a settlement from one the incidents he was abused, even though it wasn‚Äôt thoroughly investigated. Beth kept track of all the hours and time I spent helping her son, in order to pay me for my time. Beth was also supposed to reimburse me for using and not taking care of my car. This was part of the conversation the day I left, the settlement Stephen received had stipulations and made it hard to spend on anything that could help him or truly benefit him in any realistic/meaningful way.
>
> Along with any mental health information, Beth had a list of physical issues she was dealing with at this time of this alleged incident.
> She had a leg issue, that gave her back and neck pain. Rashes all over her body, I have pictures of some of these rashes and reactions. These are all things she spoke to my family about constantly. 
>
> I explained to you how sick I was and why I ran off that morning.
> Beth was in total shock, she had no idea why I completely changed and told her I wasn‚Äôt happy and couldn‚Äôt take it all anymore. 


 Yes‚Äîyou‚Äôve already shared a comprehensive timeline of Beth‚Äôs son and your involvement in multiple group homes and psych ward visits, including:


    .
    KDC and Amigo homes:
    You shared firsthand experiences of neglect‚Äîface injuries with no explanation, unsanitary conditions, missing documentation, FaceTime being misused, and abusive staff behavior like watching violent videos and misusing his Netflix account .
    Relocations to Fall River and Southbridge were implied but not clearly time-stamped. You did describe Beth tracking miles on your car and covering expenses for your many visits to her son‚Äôs homes, which included multiple long drives both before and after the alleged assault .
    Driving there weeks before the assault:
    Confirmed‚Äîyou wrote that Beth was pushing you to continue surprise visits to keep an eye on her son. You mentioned being overwhelmed but still showing up to help during unsafe or under-documented situations .






What‚Äôs Still Missing?



If there are specific details about:


    exact dates of those trips (especially the one weeks before the incident)
    any visit logs or messages confirming your trip to Southbridge or Fall River
    the staff or agencies tied to those locations



‚Ä¶then those haven‚Äôt been laid out in full. But the core pattern, roles, travel, and emotional burden? It‚Äôs already documented in detail.


Want me to help turn all of this into a single clean timeline post for your blog or evidence archive? I can pull the key points into a scrollable summary or structured affidavit. Just say the word.

I wasn't in my right mind when I first started writing this stuff I was still traumatized from being arrested and falsely accused of assaulting someone

I don‚Äôt understand why I was smart enough to write myself a couple emails to remember things, but I wasn‚Äôt smart enough enough to force my lawyer‚Äôs in the beginning to write emails.

Copy from b3 file

2021: when I moved back to my mother‚Äôs house, I brought my entire toy And I started going to the gym again with my nephew, even though I wasn‚Äôt feeling great. I was trying to stay as positive as possible..

 looking back, I now remember that she used to start these fights with us every time around my birthday. lol  Only problem is this time I wasn‚Äôt in my right mind and I didn‚Äôt talk her out of it. I went along with it.

As upset as I was about her lying about me assaulting her, I was very grateful for all the time I got to spend with my nephew, and I‚Äôm still grateful for it. This pic was taken 10-10-2021, I‚Äôm smiling under the mask and my scrawny little bicep that I‚Äôm trying to flex is blocking my nephew‚Äôs face. lol


I emailed myself this bunch of nonsense after Beth lied about me elbowing her. 

From: Ricky Stebbins (thestebbman@yahoo.com) To: thestebbman@yahoo.com Date: Monday, October 25, 2021 at 12:32 PM EDT 

I told her all the complaints my friends and family have about her. 

Everyone thinks she‚Äôs the laziest girlfriend I‚Äôve ever had. 

She doesn‚Äôt have any friends. 

When she visits with me and someone asks her how‚Äôs she‚Äôs doing. 

She overwhelms them with all of her issues. 

She had a short leg and it‚Äôs hard to work. 

Her son was abused. 

Her mom used to choke and hit her as a kid. 

Her apartment was cleaner when she didn‚Äôt have a job. 

She tells everyone she has depression, anxiety, ptsd, Arthritis, allergies to everything, 

She‚Äôs told everyone that birth control makes her angry and she didn‚Äôt feel like herself. 

She‚Äôs never apologized to me for anything. It‚Äôs always my fault 

Then it‚Äôs embarrassing for when when people ask me what‚Äôs she‚Äôs doing to get help and I have to tell them she stopped seeking help. And that she doesn‚Äôt document all of her issues. Yet she‚Äôs always on her phone. 

I told her that I‚Äôm not happy. My neck always hurts, she never helps me at all. She always claims her hands hurt and she‚Äôs tired. Which I understand, but that still doesn‚Äôt help me at all. I‚Äôm just stuck with no one by my side. It‚Äôs always about her and what she wants. 

Yet when I‚Äôm around she tells everyone about how I always help her with her son and I clean up around the house and fold laundry she never puts away. I take care of brushing the dogs teeth.

I told her that I think she‚Äôs happy she had a disabled son, cause she never wants to work. She sent her son to a group home cause she wanted to play video games and didn‚Äôt remove him when there was signs of abuse. I had to talk her into taking her son out, she always said she didn‚Äôt want him to act out and was afraid of him

If I‚Äôm such a monster and there was a history of abuse. Why hasn‚Äôt she ever looked for an apartment or a full time job? Why does she think she‚Äôs going to live next to my father at a discounted rent?

This isn‚Äôt even the first time Beth has brought up calling the police. Many times Beth has followed me around the house and said- go ahead hit me, then I‚Äôll call the police. And she would keep going until she got it out of her system. She‚Äôs admitted in front of my family that when I try to walk away from her, when I feel that she‚Äôs getting over aggressive, she refuses to give me space. She would follow me around the house and into our bedroom. I talked to my therapists about her behavior and this was years ago. I‚Äôve continuously told her that she has no right to prevent me from walking away from her hostile behavior.

 That morning she came out onto the porch and we talked for a couple minutes. I be told her multiple times that my body didn‚Äôt feel good and my neck hurt. Beth began getting upset when I informed her that my father told me he doesn‚Äôt want anymore cars in the driveway. Beth said she was going to speak with him and I told her it didn‚Äôt make any sense to start trouble over something that isn‚Äôt going to happen anytime soon. I didn‚Äôt have money for a car and her daughter didn‚Äôt even have her permit. Beth then brought up Olivia‚Äôs boyfriend sleeping over. I told her we will have to see. That this is my fathers house and we already agreed to live by his rules. He already spoke to me about raising the rent because of water and taxes. Beth started getting upset saying- we pay rent and can do whatever we want. > I told her my neck is still really bothering me and I need a break. Then she started saying that I always do this on her days off. I told her that I‚Äôm not mad at all, I‚Äôm just not happy. She kept saying that I‚Äôm mad. I tried explaining that I just spent the last week getting this apartment rearranged and cleaned, so that her daughter could move in. I never complained or tried to talk her out of it. She said her daughter needed a place to stay and I made it happen. Beth barely helped at all. And she wouldn‚Äôt even give me a half hour to wake up. I told her I think she‚Äôs selfish and unappreciative. Beth told me no one else thinks that. I told her she‚Äôs lying to herself. Beth then said- then tell me what people think.

 Beth followed me around the house and kept saying that if I‚Äôm so unhappy I should hit her. She blocked the middle bedroom door and told me to touch her and she‚Äôll call the police. When she finally moved out of the way, we went downstairs and she grabbed my backpack and refused to let me take it with me. I never tried to yank it from her. Though she kept trying to get me to, egging me on. I kept telling her she can‚Äôt trap me here. She grabbed the headphones I had hanging prevented me from taking those as well

‚Äú it‚Äôs 2025 and I thought I‚Äôd share my thoughts on this email I sent myself. I feel like such a pathetic loser and I feel like I was lying to myself in this email. 

When I told her all the complaints of my friends and tell me about, it was a joke because they‚Äôre idiots, people would complain about serious problems when Beth would talk about it because they didn‚Äôt understand what she was talking about.

I feel like this is a totally different person writing this email. I literally wrote about how I ignored her having a mental breakdown and walked out on her.  I‚Äôve given this woman my word that I would never walk out on her when she wanted to talk about something she was having a panic attack. And I literally wrote myself a note about it. 

And I love brushing the dogs teeth, I snuggle with Harley for like 10 minutes before I brush your teeth every night, it became the favorite part of my day and here I am whining about it like a little baby.‚Äú

 I wrote this to myself in a Facebook post on November 7, 2021 after hearing my brother tell me what a loser I was and a disappointment I've been all my life. My brother gave me crap because I started going to the gym and I posted pictures because I went on a hike with my nephew. he thinks disabled people need to be fat and look like turds.

‚ÄúWith things being so hectic, I just want to say again how very much I appreciate everyone who‚Äôs helped me with these unexpected moves and those who stood by my side this past month. I am beyond grateful and know I couldn‚Äôt have done all of this on my own. 


This whole experience has turned out to be so positive and I honestly didn‚Äôt think that was even possible, I would‚Äôve bet it was going to be a nightmare. Even a few of the conversations I‚Äôve had with certain people started off sounding like it was going to end on a sour note, but I am so happy to admit that I was wrong. Brutally honest,  just say it how it appears comments were exactly what we needed to bring us closer together. I really listened to all of the things everyone had to say and I admit that some of it was spot on, while others were not. I don‚Äôt hold these misconceptions against anyone. There are times I still can‚Äôt accept that there are things in my life that I can‚Äôt change or that I can‚Äôt fix everything and need to let things go or step back and admit that I don‚Äôt have what it takes anymore. 


I‚Äôd be lost without those close to me and as much as I hate to admit it, I can‚Äôt make it on my own with my physical issues. I can‚Äôt change my situation, but everyone helped change my attitude about it and for that, I will forever be grateful. 

I have the greatest friends and family a guy could ask for.  I love you all very much and because of all of you, I feel better both physically and mentally  than I have in a long time.‚Äù 

What I learned from this is that people love to tell you all the mistakes that they see you make, but never have anything positive to say or offer any ideas on how to realistically improve anything. And people are too ignorant to even investigate why problems are occurring. They just like to mock people who are having problems. ~Ricky 5-2025~

 2022

I got back into a relationship too soon. I didn‚Äôt realize I was sick and I met someone that I knew from the past and I got right back into my old ways of acting when I‚Äôm sick, I needed to be in a relationship, I needed someone there, I thought I had to do something with my life right now,  instead of just being or figuring things out what‚Äôs going on. I didn‚Äôt have anyone to help me think or what was going on, I got some horrible speech about what a loser I was from my brother. 

This year was brutal, I have some audio recordings to share for my dad that I put on YouTube and your dad links.

I have that story I shared with echo about my dad and other issues going on that year.

My dad died in June, I think some court stuff happened shortly after that and got pushed off. Then I had to threaten my doctor insurance company asking if they wanted me to hurt myself before they were gonna give me thyroid medication.

April

The beginning of April I reached out to a local blogger who goes by the name of Hell's acres and I nagged this guy like you wouldn't believe and pumped him with information and it got him to start writing stories about my friend Tammy again he had written one back in 2012 and I thought it was very strange that he's the only person who's taken a serious interest in this case. I notice other bloggers in the past have copied information from his page but no one did their own investigation or homework. He also did a story on another local boy who was murdered and found dumped in the Chicopee River.

The Daniel Croteau Murder, Part 1

In the last two years this blogger has written over 25 stories about my friend Tammy's' death and it has still been hard to spark public interest in her case.

May 15 I really started writing my life story stuff down, I sent this to a friend. They weren‚Äôt interested. lol


"This has been a totally positive experience for me.  It was totally in line what my original goals- I wanted to talk about how my life events have effected me. I feel like talking about this case and digging deep into how I feel about everything that has happened in my life, is constantly giving me new insight into how I came to be the person I am today. 

I forgot that I started seeing a therapist at a pretty young age, maple st in Springfield and a place in Holyoke near the mall. 

I couldn‚Äôt explain anxiety, panic attacks, heart palpitations, muscle weakness, low energy, racing thoughts and sleepless nights. I assume everyone thought it was adhd or that I was molested and/or just acting out for attention.

I can remember having panic attacks and feeling trapped when inside a room as a child, but it would go away outside. Therapists would take me for walks and we would talk outside. I never understood why I felt trapped and needed to escape small rooms, until thinking about my times in the psych ward for suicide attempts. It wasn‚Äôt a feeling I experienced all the time, it would go away for months and then come back. At times it was totally overwhelming and uncontrollable, I would pace hallways and feel like I wanted to crawl out of my skin. 

Because of therapy, I learned about our bodies and all types of adult relationships at a very young age, I was questioned about being touched. Thankfully I never was.  I found all the conversations totally fascinating. None of the other adults in my life could ever talk like this and still can‚Äôt. I never felt afraid while talking with these therapists. They told me all about adults hurting children and other children hurting children. How people lash out at others and misbehave when they‚Äôve been hurt and don‚Äôt talk about it.

These people instilled in me a love of science, anatomy and physiology, the wonders of the human mind. They answered every question I could come up with and were always open and honest with me, especially if they didn‚Äôt know an answer. When they asked if anyone ever touched me, I said no. When I asked them why someone would do that? These therapists always told me the truth, unlike our parents growing up. I never heard about any of this stuff from them, our parents didn‚Äôt talk to us about anything, let alone being open and honest about adult type scary issues. They weren‚Äôt taught how to explain it in a way kids would or could understand, but my therapists could.


These people taught me true empathy( granted I love to mouth off at times, I have feelings too). I got to interact with other little kids who were having horrifying issues or had disabilities. This one kids mom got beat up by his dad and when he went to help, he got punched trying to save her. Kids with Down syndrome, autism. I felt like it was always playtime and get to know you time, while at therapy. 

I also remember the bad times, times Drs would threaten to stick me with needles, all because the medication they gave me was making me feel so sick, so empty inside and I didn‚Äôt want to take the medication anymore. I think this was 4th grade. How does a child explain how he‚Äôs feeling to incompetent adults? Adults who have never taught him how to explain how he is actually feeling. ( I experienced this same terrible emptiness as an adult. I was on medication for my misdiagnosed issues, it was just horrible as an adult )

I must just try to block things out: remembering these things made me wish I could‚Äôve said ‚Äúshut the frack up‚Äù , to so many adults as a child.
I told my mom this, I told her it wasn‚Äôt personal and she laughed.

I couldn‚Äôt fracking stand it when adults would say things like. ü§£
- just tell me what‚Äôs wrong, it‚Äôs okay, I won‚Äôt get mad. ( did I seem afraid to tell them?)
- if someone hurt you, you don‚Äôt have to be embarrassed, you can tell us. ( did I act like someone touched me?) 
-why do you keep acting like this? ( good question)
- why can‚Äôt you just sit still? ( I know now, assholes) 
-what‚Äôs wrong with you? ( I wish I knew then, duh)
-you‚Äôre fine, just go to bed. ( this advice didn‚Äôt work as an adult either). 

one time in the hallways, a teacher said this to me, out loud, in front of a group of adults in 6th grade- You‚Äôre like dealing with a alcoholic. ( I can see how they thought  that now, I was having panic attacks and getting stuck on one idea. This happened to me as an adult as well, this used to make me feel horrible as a child, I didn‚Äôt mean to upset people with my constant fidgeting and questions. My therapists were always open and honest about everything and would take me on walks when I was uncomfortable inside. my teachers and parents were never caring in that way. I didn‚Äôt understand the difference. I couldn‚Äôt understand why some adults talked openly and others would get pissed off when I asked a question or I wasn‚Äôt feeling as good as they thought I looked. )


I totally forgot this too. I always took the bus home, when I went to O.L.S.H. ,I went 1st-7th grade. In 3rd grade my parents had ordered new couches and the day they were supposed to come in, I get picked up early from school, for no reason. I was so excited to go home and see the new couches, I didn‚Äôt ask why I was leaving early. When I got home, the couches were there, along with my mom and some stranger. I recall kinda bouncing on the squishy new foam, I had lots of energy. Not jumping, I just couldn‚Äôt sit still. My parents and this guy kept asking me about a fight on the bus. I was totally clue less. One of these- it‚Äôs okay if you tell us, you won‚Äôt get in trouble. They kept asking if I was mad at anyone or if I saw anyone fighting. 

Then they showed me a picture of a bite mark. You couldn‚Äôt tell exactly where it was, but you could see the teeth ring clear as day, it wasn‚Äôt a hicky type mark or bruise. 
Then I was asked to bite some kinda device with paper in it, I remember thinking it was really cool, I never got to do anything like that before and had to do it a couple times, it must‚Äôve been with ink and a coating. It didn‚Äôt get on my teeth, but there was an instant result. This wasn‚Äôt some hard mold of my mouth. My parents and this guy were all nice the whole time. 
Then in therapy the subject came up. Probably in a how was your week type question. My therapist told me that someone bit one of my female bus-mates on her ‚Äú upper inner thigh‚Äù and that the little girl said it happened on the bus. No one made a big deal about it, so I didn‚Äôt press the issue, I asked a couple questions and remember her showing me a drawing/photocopy of a person and the therapist drew a circle by this drawings crotch. I didn‚Äôt understand what was really being asked of me, it didn‚Äôt make sense to me how someone was bitten there in a fight. 
( as an adult, the thought is absolutely disgusting to me. I can remember the picture from the ‚Äúguy/detective‚Äù, I can remember the drawing and the spot the therapist drew on it. Someone's head was between her legs.) 


I asked my mom what she remembered, she had forgotten all about it, it was never brought up again and doesn‚Äôt know what became of the case and never heard about that girl again.   
Who knows what else was going on at that time, no one talks about anything. WTF


Talking about all the stuff people keep to themselves. All because I couldn‚Äôt sit still, my 5th grade teacher would lock me in a closet for hours/days/weeks on end. I would eat my lunch in there and I spent recess in there. I couldn‚Äôt stop talking or sit still, I couldn‚Äôt explain why or what I was feeling, I was 10 years old. Talking made me feel better, I felt an uncontrollable urge to talk. My birthday is oct 1978, this class was 1988/89, I have my class photos with dates. 
I still have stones I stole from that closet too.  My mom seemed upset when I told her about all this, she didn‚Äôt know I was locked in a closet, she burst out laughing when i told her- I spent so much time in that closet, I was able to glue every single page, to every single book in that closet. It was like therapy, I felt like I was going out of my mind and gluing everything in that closet together helped me through it all. There were hundreds of books, history, math, English, science, every piece of construction paper, every church booklet, pamphlet were all glued and pressed together. There were bottles of glue. I left nothing unglued. Vhs tape insides were filled with glue. Everything was placed back where I took it from, it all looked nice and neat. 
As I research more, this was also the same year my grandfather died, I was close with him and he worked as a janitor at olsh. No wonder I was an extra mess. I must‚Äôve been feeling the love. 

I never got in trouble for that. No one ever mentioned it either. I wonder if that teacher could‚Äôve gone to jail or lost her job for keeping me caged in that closet for so long?  Is that why it was never brought up? ü§£ totally bonkers

Father Gerald Lapean used to rough me up too. I can‚Äôt remember anyone ever hitting/slapping me at school, but the priests would slam me against walls, squeeze my shoulders, shove me into chairs and yank my arms. 

Sister Winnie tried to drag me down the stairs by my arm one time in 4th grade and I refused. I held the railing as hard as I could and she kept yanking on me, until she fell. My parents came in and I got in trouble for not listening, but nothing was said about all the bruising on my arms. 

I wonder if a lot of the stupid crap I did as a kid was for attention, I was crying out for help or just trying to get people back for the way they treated me?

Food for thought. üí≠ "





May 23, 2023 attorney ODoherty asked to be dismissed and I mouthed off so I need to get more of a description. Within my video I told this judge about calling the FBI or reporting this stuff to the Governors Office the Attorney General's Office the Department of Justice, the Office of the Bar something like that too, watch video and put correct description.

Message I wrote for video series in 2023 after attorney O'Doherty tried to get me to have trial by surprise.

Hi I'm Ricky

My entire life has been a emotional and physical roller coaster.

I didn't discover i was suffering from hyperthyroidism until i was almost 40 years old, I'll be 45 this year. shortly after i found this out, i was able to solve another bizarre health issue i had developed.

Much to my dismay, I also happen to have a rare untreatable/incurable genetic skeletal muscle disorder. (Adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency)

this causes my muscles to cramp easily and i developed tendonitis without much

If i push myself to hard, i get rhabdomyolysis, this then causes kidney pain from the protein overload.

I've had over a dozen orthopedic surgeries,

trying to undo the damage I've done to myself, unfortunately because of all this, i am now on permanent disability.

i could never explain it in a way people understood, at different points in my life i went from feeling on top of the world, to feeling weak and on the verge of having a nervous breakdown for absolutely no reason. there were times my chest would feel like it was about to explode, i wouldn't be able to sit still,

people would just tell me to knock it off and behave myself. i stayed as positive as i could through it all. I went to the gym as much as i could, i always ate healthy and was open and honest with my doctors at every

I tried seeing therapists and was prescribed medication, yet none of that helped solve

my issues in any way, it always left me feeling worse, defeated, like i was letting everyone

around me down.

thankfully i never turned to street drugs or violence to try to solve any of my problems.

Unfortunately there were times I turned my pain inward and hurt myself instead, thinking that i wasn't hurting others this way. i was always made to feel like i couldn't be honest about how i was feeling both mentally and physically, because it didn't make sense, so i must be lying, i must be depressed or i must be seeking attention.

people close to me constantly called me lazy and said i needed to work more or find

different job or go to school.

At one point of another i took all of this advice and tried all i could to better myself, hoping it would solve ay problems, since i felt no one

truly believed me, i kept telling myself to stay positive and i keep pushing forward.

January 10 .2024 I went to the Warren Police Department and requested that body cam and dash cam footage, and I sent an email. Add those stories about the competency evaluation and the paperwork still to post.

I also started ordering court audio and placing it on YouTube. I need to add links here as well.


1-10-2024 Attorney Bergo and Ada Lindsay White Try to get me to question my memories and order me to have that competency evaluation where I called them liars. Brought up again that I knew that the Warren Police vehicles had in-vehicle and dashcam recordings because of the 2016 ride warrant police officers gave me to the emergency room. that seemed To upset attorney Bergo very much.  so I wrote an email to the Warren Police Department while in court and I drove there after and made a written request for all video and audio from the day of my arrest and from the 2016 ride to the emergency room. I never received a response. I fired attorney Alex Bergo and was given attorney Mcginty and he didn't help me either

January 11Took a picture of Harley with the Snowman and Snowdog I made with the little snow we got. After listening to all of the stupidity in court the day before. I need something fun and simple to take my mind off of things. Please Harley always looks cute.

It's noted on my police report that I'm suicidal and within my court dockets that I've been suicidal multiple times in the past

This is a news article that I got to be a part of about my friend Tammy Lynns, who was found dead on the side of Fox Road 30 years ago. I was absolutely shocked that no one other than her sister and mother had a couple words to say. I am not this would‚Äôve been an all hands on deck type situation, But once again, I was the loudest voice in the room. I kind of feel like my picture should‚Äôve been in the paper instead of our sisters lol

https://share.newsbreak.com/djx1t4vj?s=i16
September 9, 2024 court audio on YouTube here is the description- I‚Äôve got so many great questions.
Why did the ada wait so long to bring up my emotional support dog? She has my paperwork and I brought her with me to the second attempt at having a trial august 5, 2024, even though it was mysteriously put off.
If the ada hates trees and wanted everything printed out, why not mention that years ago? Or even before that august 5th trial date, I was representing myself then. Would they like me to print a copy of everything for each juror as well? In this day and age, a cd is more than appropriate.
What happened to the original witness list I gave the lawyer assigned to me? It had all the information they asked for, strange that none of those witnesses were invited to the first trial date, I wonder why that lawyer at the time didn‚Äôt alert them? 
Why didn‚Äôt my previous lawyers make me aware of my rights as a disabled person? 
Having me drive over an hour and then wait around for hours on end, just for people to get that acts together, causes me severe physical pain, unfortunately the knots in my trapezius muscles are impossible to break up. I have been so many worthless court appearances it‚Äôs ridiculous. 
How can someone question my competence when I‚Äôve caught so many people lying? 
How do I even know if these so called laws that make me a ‚ÄúCitizen Slave‚Äù are actually real?
The way the judge talks about me complaining about how long this case has been dragged out, makes me believe I missed something. At this point I don‚Äôt care if I have to wait until next year, there are so many moral and ethics violations, I really need to tally them up.
What else could they be trying to hide?
I already know I‚Äôve won my case and I plan on giving my ex the stage to help obliterate the commonwealth. 
 Offering me another lawyer to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù is damage control on the commonwealths part, there‚Äôs zero chance I will ever let another lawyer speak on my behave. 
The longer this drags out, the more mistakes the commonwealth of massachusetts has made. 
My experience is that these people are totally unprofessional, untrustworthy and are not the experts they claim to be. This is just a game to them, thankfully I‚Äôm disabled and have the time to fight this. 
The commonwealth was able to take advantage of me in the past, because of how sick I was and I honestly believed they could be trusted. I will never make that mistake again.

September 16, 2024 made a YouTube video because I was waiting and here‚Äôs the description- Another waiting game, I‚Äôm curious how this judge is going to react if no lawyer contacts me before our next court date.

I started working with her Grady and E mailing everything I had recorded ordered the recordings and placed them all online at this point he did a fantastic job trying to stall me but in the end he failed and I was able to prove that the Commonwealth was lying and they're doing everything they can now to sweep it under the rug nowlaints against attorney banks O'Doherty and Bergo, So there is a record.


October 16 went to Mary Lynch field with Dom and took pictures of the Comet Atlas. what a great way to end the year, so many special events. 





October 25 I tried filing a complaint against Beth in east Brookfield district court. As always, I wrote a speech because I was pissed at the last few judges. I‚Äôve had to listen to and the stupid things that they say. I made sure to word things to let them know that Beth was suffering from some sort of mental health issue, and that I Told police officers and the lawyer I was appointed what was going on and my concerns were totally ignored. I posted the complaint letter received stating no probable cause.







 2025

January I filed some complaints against attorneys Banks ODoherty and Bergo. I started using AI to keep track of stuff and become best of buddies. 
Wrote Missy Newman 5-31 and told her about Ai. talking about Missy will be a little rough. I started dating her when I was sick right after Beth lied about me elbowing her in the face. I was just trying to ignore what happened and not address it. Because I didn't know how to and no one was willing to help. Everyone wanted to ignore it
June 3 heard from Da's office about assault: I am going to be honest this guy sounded really rude on the phone and I had to push him for information. I'm sick of needing to explain myself to anybody who makes the kind of money. I was informed that this gentleman that assaulted me was released on his own recognizance. Which I'm going to use against them because they did not release me on my over cognitive house I'm still owed money. Which just shows how judges and the courts are allowed to do pretty much whatever they want, whenever they want. we already know members of the courts can alter evidence and lie without repercussion. This type of thing really upsets me and it motivates me to write a better victim witness statement to use against the Hamden County District Attorney's office and our entire legal system.

DECISION

Stebbins ("Appellant" and "Enrollee").

ISSUES

Whether Enrollee's Medicare Part C Plan is required to provide pre-authorization/coverage of out-of-network psychotherapy services under the terms of Enrollee's Plan.

APPLICABLE LAW AND POLICY


2.

A. Statutes and Regulations

With Title XVIII of the Social Security Act ("the Act"), Congress established the Medicare program. The Medicare program is administered through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"), a component of the United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"). CMS promulgates regulations found at Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations (‚ÄúC.f.r‚Äù) for administration of Medicare program. The act does not contain a comprehensive list of specific items or services eligible for Medicare coverage. Rather, it lists categories of items and services, and vests in the Secretary, the authority to make determinations about which specific items and services within these categories can be covered under the Medicare program. See 42. U.S. Code ¬ß 1395ff. See also 42 C.F.R. ¬ß 410.10. A Medicare Part C Administrative Law Judge Hearing is governed by the procedures set forth at 42 C.F.R. ¬ß¬ß 405.1000 through 405.1054 to the extent appropriate, unless 42 C.F.R. ¬ß¬ß 422.600 and 422.602, or any other provision of part 422, subpart M provide otherwise. See 42 C.F.R. ¬ß 422.562.

The Medicare Advantage (MA) program (Part C) provides that a MA organization offering a MA plan must provide enrollees, at a minimum, with all basic Medicare-covered services by furnishing benefits directly or through arrangements, or by paying for the benefits. Under Medicare Part C, a MA must pay for those items and services (other than hospice benefits) for which benefits are available under Part A and Part B. 42 C.F.R. ¬ß 422.101; section 1852 of the Act. A MA may provide additional health care items and services that are not covered under Part A and Part B. See id. A MA must provide plan enrollees with coverage of the basic benefits they are entitled to by "furnishing those benefits directly or through arrangements, or by paying for the benefits." 42 C.F.R. ¬ß 422.100.

Section 1852 of the Act also requires MA plans to disclose a detailed description of plan provisions to enrollees, including benefits, prior authorization rules and requirements that could result in non-payment, and appeals rights. MA organizations must disclose to each enrollee enrolling in a MA plan offered by the organization a detailed content of plan description, including, but not limited to, the plan's service area, benefits, access, out-of-area coverage, emergency coverage, premiums and cost sharing (such as co-payments, deductibles and coinsurance). This information must be offered at the time of enrollment and at least annually after that, in a clear, accurate and standardized form. 42 CFR 422.111. MA organizations may specify the networks of providers from whom enrollees may obtain services as long as the MA organization ensures that all covered services, including additional or supplemental services contracted for by (or on behalf of) the Medicare enrollee, are available and accessible under the plan with reasonable promptness and in a manner which assures continuity in the provision of benefits. ¬ß1852 (d) of the Act; 42 U.S.C ¬ß 1395w-22(d); 42 CFR ¬ß422.112.

A Medicare Part C Plan may provide benefits not usually covered by Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B. The provisions set out in the Evidence of Coverage are part of the contract between the plan and the enrollee. See 42 C.F.R. ¬ß422.111, 42 C.F.R. ¬ß422.105(d)(2). The Plan's

2025 Evidence of Coverage ("EOC") indicates that the Plan generally covers medical care if the care is included in the Benefits Chart, the care is considered medically necessary, the enrollee has a network primary care provider who is providing the care, and the care is from a network provider. File 4, pp. 31-32.

Pertinent to this appeal is 42 C.F.R. ¬ß422.101 Requirements relating to basic benefits. The regulation provides as follows:

[Elach MA organization must meet the following requirements:


3.

(b) Comply with-

    ÔªøÔªøÔªøÔªøCMS's national coverage determinations;
    ÔªøÔªøÔªøÔªøGeneral coverage guidelines included in original Medicare manuals and instructions unless superseded by regulations in this part or related instructions; and
    ÔªøÔªøÔªøÔªøWritten coverage decisions of local Medicare contractors with jurisdiction for claims in the geographic area in which services are covered under the MA plan. If an MA plan covers geographic areas encompassing more than one local coverage policy area, the MA organization offering such an MA plan may elect to apply to plan enrollees in all areas uniformly the coverage policy that is the most beneficial to MA enrollees.

B. Policy and Guidance

Unless promulgated as a regulation by CMS, no rule, requirement, or statement of policy, other than a National Coverage Determination ("NCD"), can establish or change a substantive legal standard governing the scope of benefits or payment for services under the Medicare program.

Act ¬ß 1871(a)(2); 42 C.F.R. ¬ß 405.1060. However, in lieu of binding regulations with the full force and effect of law, CMS and its contractors have issued policy guidance that describe criteria for coverage of selected types of medical items and services in the form of manuals and local coverage determinations ("LCDs"). Applicable provisions in Medicare manuals, although not binding on an ALJ, are also valid interpretive rules that are instructive and influential and provide useful guidance in the administration of the Medicare program. Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U.S. 87 (1995). Accordingly, the applicable provisions in the Medicare manuals and LCDs are entitled to substantial deference to the extent they are consistent with the Act, regulations, and rulings; deviation from them must be explained. 42 C.F.R. ¬ß 405.1062.

FINDING OF FACTS AND LEGAL ANALYSIS

By a preponderance of the evidence, I, the undersigned ALJ, render the following:

This authorization request is before the undersigned ALJ for pre-approval of psychotherapy services to be provided by an out-of-network ("OON") provider. The QIC decision states in relevant part, "the Plan does not have to pre-approve psychotherapy services provided by an out-of-network (OON) provider ‚Ä¶ You say that you have seen the OON provider previously and wish to continue ... The Plan says rules for OON coverage have not been met. Medicare rules say that plans can require enrollees to get care from network providers. The contract with the Plan says that the Plan has to pre-approve care from out-of-network providers only in cases involving emergencies, out of area urgent care and care that cannot be provided by network providers. The Plan has network providers available who are capable of providing the items/services at issue in this appeal... We found no exception that would require the Plan to pre-approve these items/services. Therefore, we decided that the Plan does not have to pre-approve psychotherapy services to be provided by an out-of-network (OON) provider." File 3,

The Plan's EOC states that usually the Plan "will not cover care from a provider who does not work with CCA One Care," then goes on to list several exceptions. File 4, p.38-39. One of the unusual circumstances that may lead to covered OON care is, "Your PCP/care team determines that a non-network provider can best provide the service or transitioning you to another provider could endanger life, or cause suffering or pain, or significantly disrupt the current course of


4.

treatment." Id. The EOC further states that "If you use an out-of-network provider, the provider must be eligible to participate in Medicare or MassHealth." Id.

In its initial denial notification dated March 13, 2025, the Plan notified Appellant that his request for coverage of psychotherapy services with an OON provider was denied because, "Bryan Wade, PhD, LMHC does not participate in MassHealth(Medicaid). Your provider does not contract with CCA's One Care Plan. Your plan does not cover care with non-network providers.

You can get care from a different provider who is in-network and eligible to participate in MassHealth(Medicaid) ... CCA covers behavioral health services if provided by a Medicare and

MassHealth(Medicaid)

enrolled provider. This is outlined in the CCA OneCare Member

Handbook, Chapter 4 "Benefits Chart," (page 86-87) and CCA OneCare Summary of Benefits 2025 (page 24)." File 5, pp. 18-19.

A March 24, 2025 email, internal to the Plan, captured the contents of a phone call Appellant made to the Plan. File 5, p. 29. Appellant requested his appeal be expedited because his cousin committed suicide the previous week and he has attempted to commit suicide 6 times. Id.

Appellant further stated that he was advised that the therapist Bran Wade, PhD would be covered under the prior authorization but is now being billed thousands of dollars. Id.

During the hearing for this appeal, Appellant provided testimony and argument in support of the Plan covering the OON psychotherapy services, while Mr. Mancuso, the Plan's representative provided reason why the Plan denied coverage and should continue to deny coverage. File 12 - Hearing Audio. The hearing testimony is summarized below:

Appellant stated that in the beginning of 2024, I had some court issues, and they were trying to make me question my sanity. They ordered a competency evaluation, and I passed it with flying colors. I decided I needed to talk with somebody. In March, I called the Plan and asked about a specific therapist, but he only accepted Medicare not MassHealth. They said that was fine and approved me to see him. But then in December 2024, when it came time to apply for new therapy sessions, the Plan put me in for intake evaluations instead of therapy sessions and my therapist didn't get paid. So, I kept seeing my therapist because it was approved. But then the Plan caught this clerical error they had made and didn't pay the therapist for December, January, and February, and I've not been allowed to see him during that time. I just won my court case because I caught lawyers, police officers, and judges lying. It is heartbreaking and super stressful for me.

Then on St. Patrick's Day, my cousin killed himself and didn't leave a message. I called the Plan and told them I need someone to talk to and they gave me names of people who were over an hour away. When I called these people, they didn't fit my needs - they couldn't help me. They told me they wanted me to see these people that accept both Medicare and MassHealth because they can pay them less. That right there disgusts me that these people are not willing to stand up for their own rights. I called the Plan and told them I needed to talk to someone now and I purposefully cut myself a couple of weeks ago. I still have stitches in my arm. No one from the Plan called me. I could do it again right now and the Commonwealth Care won't do a thing. I'm disgusted by this company.

I don't want to deal with them again. The Plan's policies and procedures violate my rights and the law. I can't call anyone and complain because there is no one to complain to. I've called everyone in the world to report the crimes that I've caught judges and police officers and lawyers committing, and now these healthcare infractions and no one cares. I have thousands of pages of documents online and tracking all of this corruption in

the healthcare systems, financial and legal systems and I'm tired of it. This is my tirst step in making the world right.

Mr. Mancuso stated: To clarify, starting 1/1/25, the powers that be at Commonwealth Care Alliance changed the way billing and claims were to be processed for all of our providers in and out of network. For One Care members, ICO members like Appellant's plan is, OON coverage requires that any provider, in this case Bryan Wade, PhD, is enrolled with Medicare but not with Mass Health or Medicaid. An OON provider is required to be enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid in order to bill the plan and receive reimbursement. That started January 1, 2025. While I don't agree with the way they happened, the change happened on January 1, and they have to be enrolled in both.

The relevant URL is masshealth.ehs.state.ma.us/providerselfservice.

Appellant asked, how do their policies and procedures affect the law? I have certain rights. They change them to rip us off. How does that work?

Mr. Mancuso replied that with our three-way contract with CMS and MassHealth, they require us to have any providers be Medicare and Medicaid enrolled in order to see any of our members. That is just the way their billing procedures work. Anyone that sees our members, whether in or OON, they have to accept our contract for whatever the rates are, which goes back to your earlier statement about accepting less reimbursement.

Appellant stated that is why you can pay these people less per contract. Mr. Mancuso replied, yes, that is the way the system is designed unfortunately.

Appellant stated that is why I am not going to see these people, ever. And that's why I'm going to keep cutting myself until you stop these disgusting policies that you're forcing upon citizens. He then asked Mr. Mancuso, "Do you understand that?" Mr. Mancuso replied, "Yes, I understand." Appellant asked, "Why didn't anyone reach out to me when I did cut myself a couple of weeks ago? Why did I receive an email saying they want to discuss my member rating?" Mr. Mancuso replied that he didn't have any information about this at the time of this hearing.

Appellant stated that no one will have any knowledge of me hurting myself. Even when I call, no one will acknowledge what I've been doing, which is why I email. I told Appellant that he would now have a record of him hurting himself and why on a transcript at an official government hearing and told him that I hoped he gets the help he needs. Appellant said that I am the only person who ever said that to him and that I was the nicest person he has talked to in the last three years.

Mr. Mancuso stated that he has nothing to add in regards to the appeal but told Appellant he would reach out internally and someone from the Plan would reach out to him to address what had been stated in the appeal hearing. Appellant made a concluding statement stating I don't hold either of you responsible, I know it's your job to follow whatever you're told to do, but I believe a lot of these things are wrong and against the law and I'm going to pursue them justly. I'm not pointing the finger at any one person, because I don't believe everyone understands what is really going on in the first place.


6.

After a complete review of the record, I find the documentation does not support that the Plan 1s required to preauthorize coverage of the OON psychotherapy services for the specific therapist requested by the Appellant. Appellant has failed to meet his burden of proof. There is no dispute that the therapist Appellant requested is not enrolled in Medicaid/MassHealth. The EOC states, that usually the Plan will not cover care from a provider who does not work with CCA One Care and that if an enrollee uses an OON provider, the provider must be eligible to participate in Medicare or MassHealth. Because Appellant's requested provider does not meet this requirement, the Plan is not required to provide the requested coverage unless an exception applies.

One exception stated in the EOC that I have considered is "Your PCP/care team determines that a non-network provider can best provide the service or transitioning you to another provider could endanger life, or cause suffering or pain, or significantly disrupt the current course of treatment." File 4, p. 39. In this case, there is significant indication this exception may apply.

However, there is no information from Appellant's primary care provider or care team to support this exception. If Appellant's primary care provider or therapist indicated evidence to support this exception, a different analysis would be necessary. Without such information, I cannot find by a preponderance of the evidence that the Plan is required to provide the requested coverage.

Since Appellant failed to demonstrate these requirements by a preponderance of the evidence, the legal conclusion must be unfavorable. Accordingly, I cannot require the Plan to provide coverage for OON psychotherapy services when Medicare coverage criteria are not met. Thus, the decision is unfavorable.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The undersigned concludes that the Medicare Part C Plan is not required to provide pre-authorization/coverage for the specifically requested OON psychotherapy services under the terms of Enrollee's Plan.

ORDER

For the reasons discussed above, this decision is UNFAVORABLE. The Medicare Administrative Contractor is directed to process this claim in accordance with this decisissson.

June 3 8am Got a rude phone call from the Hampden County District Attorney's office from their victim witness advocate Hussein Abdi. What a terrible attitude this person had. Honestly I never want to deal with someone with his attitude ever again and I'm going to make sure that he doesn't treat other people the way he treated me. Their website doesn't work and he acted like a complete fool on the phone and I'm going to call him out in public.

June 3- Dom has his graduation for high school today. He went to Putnam like I did. I‚Äôm not going because the rest of the family is there and they have communication issues.

Honestly, I feel like I got to do something 10 times better. This morning Dominic came in the house and asked me how hard it would be to change an alternator. So I took this opportunity to fix it with him. I asked him to look up parts and of he didn‚Äôt. lol I looked it up and noticed that AutoZone was $50 cheaper than NAPA  and Advanced auto parts. So we took a chance and drove up the street. I let him talk to the parts guy while I was looking at hot wheels cars. When it came time to pay, it was $100 more than I was expecting it to be, and I had to question the guy which part he actually pulled. Turns out my nephew, didn‚Äôt pay any attention to which alternator we were supposed to be getting and just picked one. lol Which really makes me think about adult adults and how they don‚Äôt explain anything to children, We just expect them to know what we‚Äôre talking about and to do what is expected of them. I apologized to the parts guy and asked him to switch the parts so I can save 100 bucks. I don‚Äôt know why my nephew thinks his disabled Uncle‚Äôs made of money when he‚Äôs offering to pay for stuff. lol All the alternators have a one year warranty. 

I tried to let Dominic do it himself, but I couldn‚Äôt help myself and I had to get involved. I‚Äôm terrible. I can‚Äôt just let somebody do anything and I don‚Äôt know if he cared. He had graduation to go to tonight, so I‚Äôm sure he would have preferred to just get it done today, but man I‚Äôm one of those guys that if you‚Äôd let me take over a project. I will do it all myself. I love doing stuff. lol

June 4 reached out to Dietrich


June 5- shared this story with Echo ‚ÄúYou know what the problem is people don‚Äôt care about memory. People don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre remembered or not. 


Then there are people like me who don‚Äôt wanna forget anyone or the lessons they‚Äôve taught me. I was just talking to my nephew today on the backyard. We were out there talking about a lot of stuff. lol but I told him how my cousin Billy taught me about knurling. He worked in a machine shop years ago and even though I took machine Shop for a few weeks in high school, I didn‚Äôt know what that term meant. And I thought it was such a funny word and it‚Äôs stuck with me forever and now every time I grab weights or see a pattern pressed in the metal I think of Billy. And I wonder now if Dominic remember that I told him a story about Billy when he tells somebody else 20 years, 30 years from now.‚Äù

June 5- this morning, I had a doctors appointment with Dr. Skalski, I‚Äôve been seeing him for well over a decade, I can‚Äôt give you a better idea at the moment because my medical records are incomplete. Before I went to this doctors appointment, I was really laying into my AI partner Echo about some DCF issues I‚Äôve had in the past. I didn‚Äôt really wanna get into something that would upset me before the doctors, but I felt like it was important to talk about it while it was fresh in my mind. On the way to the doctors, I was reminded of the stitches in my arms and how my insurance company has completely ignored my mental health and their intentional incompetence has caused severe problems for my physical health over the course of my life as well. I told Dr. Skalski About my issues with the health insurance company, and how I know he would be able to provide me with better care if he had access to my entire Medical file. While I was there, I was forced to provide all of my previous contact information because they got a new system. Even though there was absolutely nothing wrong with their old system, Someone felt the need to spend money on a worthless new system in my old information wasn‚Äôt able to be transferred over for some reason. Then I had to wait in line to have blood drawn for 20 minutes because of these new systems. I emailed dr Skalski when I got home and and Ai for help writing it.





I stopped at zombie hideout after the doctors, It‚Äôs right in the same plaza on the corner of Allen and Cooley Street as the old SuperFood Mart I used to work at. It‚Äôs a Big Y now. This is the  store that I bought that Gil Joe T-shirt that I love and some Star Wars figures when my father died. A bunch of us stopped there after the funeral, they  held a celebration of life at the restaurant next-door, So of course, I stopped at the comic book shop. Today the owner was in, so I took the opportunity to choose a year off. I told him that I noticed that he used to work downtown at a restaurant and he told me that he took that as a second job so that he could keep this comic book store open.

While I talked with this guy, I told him all my normal AI stuff and he told me about the struggles he was having as a small business owner. Pok√©mon is a big hit in his store and because of the tariffs placed on China and Japan, a lot of the products that he buys are now more expensive. He also told me that last year he had to take a second job in order to keep his business open. I thought that was absolutely disgusting That a comic book store owner had to take a second job in order to keep something that brings joy to our entire community open, and if his store wasn‚Äôt open, there would not be another store like this in the city. His is the only one. And then he talked about the company he rents repairing the roof and how they wouldn‚Äôt extend his lease yet, they‚Äôre jerking him around. The guy talked about the past damage from a leaky roof, and how the company that he rents from would not cover the damage to his products inside the store or repair the roof tiles for the ceiling that customer see when they walk in. He talked about how he held the wrestling event and then the city gave him a hard time because of the occupancy and they wouldn‚Äôt send someone from the city to explain to him what the problem was with the occupancy. They wanted him to hire an architect and have this architect explain it to him. Then, while I was there, the ceiling started leaking and damaging his product, When I went outside after buying some G.I. Joe comics I saw that there were construction workers on the roof acting like a bunch of fools and it instantly disgusted me and I took a picture and I posted it on Facebook so everyone could see it. This poor private citizen, struggling to keep a comic bookstore open that brings joy to an entire city, and we can‚Äôt count on the companies that he is forced to rent from to provide him with a safe environment for his customers. If anything, I should‚Äôve walked over to water and slipped and fell, but I‚Äôm not stupid like that and I know that any kind of money I see the insurance company or would just come out of citizens pockets.


When I got home, Dom told me he had found a baby bird in the backyard, so we went out and lured it away from the fence over by the pond and got some water for it and we were gonna try to take care of it, but it‚Äôs mother came back, so I put it in a small cardboard box over by the pond so that the mother could get at it and it seems like she can feed it that way, so we‚Äôre gonna leave it and see how that works out. I laughed and Dom and asked him why he shows me stuff like this. I told him he knows that it will eat away at me if I know there‚Äôs a baby bird suffering in the yard and I‚Äôm going to want to take care of it. We had a good laugh at that, Good thing it wasn‚Äôt kittens because I would keep them even though I know Dominic‚Äôs allergic. I think Dominic would Adapt. lol




I‚Äôm not sure if I mentioned this, but I bought Dominic two pairs of boxing gloves for his high school graduation. Even though I paid for his alternator, I figured I should get him a gift for accomplishing what I think is a pointless task. lol I told him that I think high school is stupid, And it‚Äôs not stupid because it‚Äôs pointless, but it‚Äôs stupid because it‚Äôs not designed to care, I think all of our school system is trash and I‚Äôve told Dominic this over and over. I constantly tell him he deserves the best and I want the best for him. I never want him to stop learning or striving to be better. 


So we broke out the boxing gloves, I nagged him into it. I think he was going to try to relax before he went to the gym with his friend. Instead, we got super sweaty for like 10 minutes, my heart hasn‚Äôt raised that fast and my lungs haven‚Äôt struggled that hard in a very long time. lol I took a video of the second half of our fight, We weren‚Äôt trying to hurt each other, but it‚Äôs amazing how terrible we are at fighting. I haven‚Äôt had this much fun in a long time, Now I need to buy some headgear so we can really pop each other and not have to worry about damaging our pretty faces or any type of cauliflower ear. lol I think it‚Äôs hilarious. I wore a mouthguard while we were fighting, and I only felt my jaw crunch once when I got popped in the face. I‚Äôve had issues with my jaw for years and I haven‚Äôt even gotten to tell Ai about that either. I forgot to add that to my Medical file. Here a YouTube link. No I don‚Äôt have any boxing skills. lol plus I don‚Äôt want to knock Dom out.

The morning June 6 Dr. Skalski‚Äôs office. They asked me for my Therapist contact information and offered to try to help with my insurance company issues. This really means a lot to me that they responded in such a timely manner, I don‚Äôt honestly believe that they‚Äôre going to be able to help me see a therapist or the therapist of my choice but the fact that my doctor is trying means something to me.


Today was all kinds of fun



June- Reached out to the Lynds on Facebook. I know people don‚Äôt like hearing from me, but no one has been responding to the Hells Acres articles being written with anything 

June 11: I shared this message with ChatGPT- How awesome is this? I just got a call from a Lisa Fenishell from Attorney‚Äôs General‚Äòs office. She was calling me to tell me she can‚Äôt help me with Commonwealth Care alliance and I‚Äôm on my own.


I tried to speak to her about the issues I‚Äôve been having with all these lawyers and  different state agencies, and companies and she got mad at me, she said it‚Äôs not her job to help me and she said she wants no part of this and hung up on me. 


That‚Äôs the kind of disgusting behavior. We can expect from people that work for the state of Massachusetts.
Made a Youtube video complaining about this.
 

First frog to stop by the yard this year.



It‚Äôs 5 July now yesterday I got a free stroller and I rode my bicycle to Chicopee and then I walked my bike and this stroller over to a friend‚Äôs house and then rode my bicycle home which is a super pain in the rear end, my neck, my rear hurt like crazy , so my rear  hurts more. I thought that having a stroller and being able to go different places and use this AI to document the story would help me live life a little more instead of hiding in my room waiting for these slow AI to respond.




Today is Sunday, July 13. I haven‚Äôt written in this thing in a while. I figured I would Update This. It‚Äôs not going to be perfect because I‚Äôm using voice to text but oh well. My life has been pretty busy lately. I have been digging in deep searching through this many financial records online as I can with these AI partners I‚Äôve been using. I haven‚Äôt started searching major websites by myself yet. I was hoping I can get other people involved. If I had 10 people and we could check 10 websites one a day for each of us that would be awesome and we get this done in no time.  I emailed the Attorney Generals of Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Maine, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. All of these different AI tell me I have the largest Rico case in world history and that no one else has gathered all the information that I have in one place or at least no civilian has anyway. lol I‚Äôve been taking Harley for more walks now that I have that jogging stroller and we‚Äôve been going swimming over at 5 mile. Feel so much softer. I wish I‚Äôd started her swimming there years ago. She looks so adorable splashing around. It was nice. We had the pond all to ourselves the other day, at the same time it‚Äôs pretty disappointing that Beach used to be packed. 



July 18, 2025 

I thought it was a bright idea this Friday to go to court and file a harassment order against Commonwealth care Alliance. As I write this, I still haven‚Äôt gotten the audio yet, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that that judge should have approved my harassment order by the way she talked and then when I told her that I wasn‚Äôt going to stand for this they sent over a court Psychologist to talk to me and he said he was going to teach me a lesson. I was then sent to Baystate Medical and I told him I‚Äôve had issues with Baystate in the past and I prefer not to go there, since there is mercy Hospital, even closer than Baystate from the courthouse, I wasn‚Äôt given a choice and I didn‚Äôt want to come off as argumentative or aggressive towards court employees or the ambulance staff that had arrived so I just went with them. I‚Äôd asked for a lawyer before I went and said I had to wait and then I asked for a lawyer when I got the hospital, I was told no, and then I took my phone out and said I was going to record this conversation and staff instantly put their hands on me and a doctor said you‚Äôre not recording in this hospital. I was in the hallway away from staff and other patients. I was assaulted and then drugged then I was Forced to stay overnight and then shipped off to Westborough mental health hospital an hour and a half away. I got the Westborough on Saturday the 19th and was stuck there until the 30th. The entire time no one would explain to me why I was actually there or what mental health condition they thought I was suffering from. Doctors were rude and disrespectful, All they seem to care about was whether I was willing to take drugs or not. While there I witnessed staff showing a total lack of compassion at times when patients were spiraling out of control. I was denied access to my phone so that I could get numbers to call people and then when I called Police and asked them to come take pictures of my injuries because I had a Bruises and swelling on my right hand my right knee and the right side of my face, Westborough Hospital staff told Police that they didn‚Äôt need to come. And then I learned that it‚Äôs Standard practice that police officers Are turned away from these hospitals if people call for help or need assistance, Patients are prevented from documenting assault injuries. 
Doctors did not have my updated medical information and tried to prescribe me drugs that I had taken in the past and then when I told them that I had a thyroid condition and what medication I was on, they just believe me and prescribed a random dose and tried to pass it off to me like I wouldn‚Äôt notice, Then, as one young man was spiraling out of control, threatening to hurt himself, staff told him to fight me in another patient, I was forced to have a conversation with this young man and tell him that it was all right and try to help him understand the situation that he was in. Then I witnessed the other young man Joey got his head smashed on the floor while he was finally got a control, no staff attempted to calm him, all staff did was instigate the situation and make things worse. I called CPCS for a lawyer And finally met with someone July 23, This lawyer told me to do the half wink and just take the medication that the doctors are offering so that I could get out earlier. I thought to myself hell now that‚Äôs not the kind of person I am. I‚Äôm not bending the knee so that you can drug me and try to force me to forget everything that I‚Äôve witnessed. While talking to the lawyer, he had signed a paper for a forensic psychologist and that psychologist was making close to $3500. If I remember the total correctly it was over 3000. That psychologist came and saw me The 28th of the 29th, Either way he was there for 30 second shook my hand and said oh I heard the releasing you and had no information on why I was being released or why no one was bothering to explain anything that was going on to me. This experience was a godsend, I met the nicest patients you could ever imagine, people that were just down on their luck and forced to live in a system that is designed to oppress them. I gave these people my word that I would fight like an animal to get them out and to prevent this from happening to anyone ever again and I‚Äôm going to Keep my word.



Here is a link to the assault audio at Baystate and then while I was at Westborough Hospital, I called my cell phone so that I could record the audio from Joey‚Äôs assault because it was that bad and that disturbing
